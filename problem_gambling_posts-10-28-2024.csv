Has anyone done in house rehab programme,I have just seen someone after my third relapse and losing a lot of money and they have suggested I do an in-house 28 day rehab programme. It is pretty expensive but if this is what can get me to stop gambling forever it will be worth it long run.

Have you played Chumba? Washington Post seeks your help,"Hello

My name is Rick Maese, and I am a reporter for The Washington Post. I've run this request by your friendly moderators and appreciate them allowing me to make this little intrusion and solicit your assistance.   
  
I am in search of people who have played sweepstakes-style social casino games -- like Chumba, LuckyLand and Pulsz. We are reporting about the fast growth of these gaming operators and trying to examine the implications of this burgeoning, billion-dollar business. They're not regulated (and are specifically banned in states), but these companies are thriving, and I'm not sure people equate these games with the slots and table games you'd find at a casino. Thus, they aren't treated the same and don't have the same kinds of consumer protections in order.   
  
These games are receiving a lot of attention in the gambling industry but have flown mostly under the radar for mainstream media and many regulators. We aim to correct that, and I'm hoping you can help. We'd like to humanize the issue - offer real-life faces and experiences that will make a complex story easier to understand and relate to. We can certainly grant anonymity, if preferred.   
  
If you've had experiences playing games like Chumba or LuckyLand Slots on your phone and computer, I'd love to chat. My email address is [rick.maese@washpost.com](mailto:rick.maese@washpost.com) or you can send me a message on Reddit as well. I appreciate your consideration.

I’ve lost myself and don’t want to lose everything I love most,I have been gambling pretty badly for a couple months now. I will spend my whole paycheck at the casino then borrow money from friends and family until my next check then rinse and repeat. I’m deeply lost financially and I know that it’s becoming a problem. Yesterday I confided in a family member and told them my problem. This was hard for me to do but I need to hold myself accountable. I told them I will be sending my checks to them when I get paid as to not spend it at the casino. I took all my debit cards (thankfully don’t have credit cards) out of my wallet and put them somewhere safe at home. I’m hoping to stay strong and get back on track so I don’t lose the ones I love most and myself. I’m hoping to update in a couple months or sooner to view my progress and hopefully help anyone else in a similar situation. Good luck out there and please be kind to yourself. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ge5849/ive_lost_myself_and_dont_want_to_lose_everything/,3,1,1730130138.0
How to avoid relapse on payday??,"Hey all…
I’ve been struggling with a gambling addiction for about a year now, maybe 2. Mostly just slots online. I have quit SO many times but really have trouble sticking with it. I think the longest I’ve gone is 2 months (July-Sept)

I’m super good at not gambling when I have no money (lol) but then the moment I get paid I cannot fight the temptation.

I have tried the gambling blockers but they’re just too easy to turn off. I have self excluded from sooo many casinos but always seem to find a new one. I play there, lose all my money, and then self exclude from that casino as well. Is there any way to just self exclude from every casino I have access to? (Jesus christ the gambling industry is so fucked up.)

I’d really like to avoid giving someone else control of my finances, because I am embarrassed of how many credit cards, loans, and cash advance apps I owe money to because of the gambling. I reallyyyyy want to just put my head down, avoid gambling, and pay my freakin bills. But the question is HOW?? I could easily spend my whole check in an hour just making debt payments…but instead I find another casino and spend it there.

This is the first time I’ve reached out for help beyond talking to my husband about it. (He is aware of my addiction but thinks I am still over it since my quitting in July)",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gdnnys/how_to_avoid_relapse_on_payday/,1,0,1730069850.0
"I lost everything, my life is unrecoverable ","As a young boy in school my future was so promising. I had a thing that I was dedicating my life to, it was informatics. I used to do it like 8-10 hours daily and I had really good results, managed to place first in the national olympiad and future seemed so bright. Up until I found out gambling exists.

I started gambling when I was 14-15, with csgo skins. I didn’t even realise how quickly I got addicted to it. It’s been 10 years already and since then every single income I had, I ended up gambling and losing it. Of course even worse, I gambled out all the money that I didn’t even have, over the years I borrowed money from anyone who had a bit of trust in me, and ended up losing it all. When people I know wouldn’t give me money anymore, I took as much credits from the banks as I could. At some points even stole money from my parents to gamble/solve financial problems caused by gambling, and ended up inventing stupid reasons of why I did that. Of course the initial intention was to take the money and then return it without anyone noticing anything. Classic gambler thinking, right?
In the end they used their own savings to close some of my debts (they don’t know I’m an addict, I told them different lies about the reason of money need). They sold their car, and not only, for that. This is so unimaginable on a clear mind, they didn’t raise me like that, they are both teachers and they cultivated in me the most honest and kind values a man can have. But I am just a monster who can’t appreciate it. And now they have 0 trust in me and their disappointment is slowly transforming in deep depression and it’s all because of me. 
Right now I’m 25, been constantly in debt for the last 6 years, and it just feels like the recovery is impossible. I do work as an engineer, my income is above average, technically I could pay all my debts with 3-4 salaries, the problem is, I’ve been saying this for years, every month literally the same thing happens: I receive the salary, I instantly put a small bet like literally pennies, and in 1 day it snowballs and all the salary is gone. And it’s been like that for years, I already said a million times that this just has to stop but every month it’s just the same thing, losing every single penny that I have. 

It’s just so mentally draining, why isn’t gambling completely banned from the world we live in? It’s like a natural human weakness that is so destructive, I’m sure hundreds of thousands of people are committing suicide because of this.

A couple of days ago I received my salary, all gone now. I must pay the rent that I have no money for, I have big debts to people that have been waiting for months for me to pay them. 
I am so lost, I just don’t know what to do and how to keep going. 

Every single person that I interacted with in my life got disappointed by me, I am such a failure. The depression is so strong, I just don’t know what to do and how can I bring myself back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gds1y2/i_lost_everything_my_life_is_unrecoverable/,1,0,1730083214.0
The end is nigh,"
This all started 10 years ago whilst working in a bar, putting a few cheeky sports bets on for fun and just to pass the shift. Now it’s spiralled into something so cold and sinister, I literally can’t stop myslef from gambling, I’ve completely ruined my life. 

It’s so fucked up that when I have money I’m so irritated having to put a bet on, I feel withdrawn from everything and always on my phone. I must “go to the toilet” more than anyone else on the planet. 

I don’t even recognise myself anymore. Gambling has took all of my innocence and changed me as a person, and I don’t like this new person. All I wish for is the old me, the happy me, that seems like such a distant memory now. 

This time stopping feels different and I’m going to do everything in my power to put this in my rear view. It isnt my intention to stop, it’s my life work, it’s done, I’m done, I’m stopping for good now. You’ll see me around here a lot moving forward, let’s all beat this together. 

“Good intentions pave the road to hell” - no more intentions and lost more actual doing, let’s fucking beat this for good.

Thanks for listening to me ramble on

"Trying My Best to Quit, Pointers? ","I am 25 years old. I have gambled every single day since I was 18. And quite a bit before that. Daily Fantasy when I was like 16, put part of first ever paycheck in Bovada online. Mostly sports betting. I love craps and roulette, but have had success staying out of casinos. It's sports betting that presents the problem. I gambled through college with student loans, gambled all my credit cards to the point of being maxed out. Took out a personal loan (which I'm still paying on), and maxed them all out again. I have tried to stop and been unable to numerous times. 

I have probably lost more than $40,000 in the last seven years gambling. Most of it loaned money. 

I own my home, and pay tons of bills and gamble every leftover cent and then some. My family knows about it, but nowhere close to the extent of it. 

Today will mark ONE week since I placed a sports bet. I made it through UFC 308 and an entire football weekend. 

I don't know that I am in a place where I feel comfortable attending a GA meeting although I have read a lot of resources from their sites as well as elsewhere on Reddit. 

I have officially arrived at the point of no-return in regards to keeping my house, my dogs, and my relationship with my family in order. And have decided, as I have numerous times in the past, that I HAVE to stop. There's no other way. Anyone else with similar experiences find specific things help them get through it. A book? A hobby? Anything. I have to take my life back.

TL/DR: What helped you kick your crippling gambling addiction?

Parent taking money out of my bank account for gambling for about a year. I dont know what to do.,"I have a family member who has been taking money out of my bank account to gamble with and I don't know what to do. Basically they helped me set up my bank account as a minor and have been taking money out of my bank account that I get from work. throughout this month they have taken out somewhere around 1.1k dollars. They have had emotional conversations with me three times saying they are going to fix this and pay me back and try to stop gambling. In the latest discussion we talked about them going to a gamblers anonymous which they went to for one day (about 2 weeks ago) where they got a sponsor but we are already back to square one where they are taking money out without saying anything to me. For most people this would make them furious but they mean a lot to me and this is the only flawed thing that has happened between me and them honestly since I've been on this planet. This doesn't mean I'm not angry though. I wouldn't be writing this if I was content with this happening. I also don't necessarily need the money right now but taking it from me is not right as I will need it down the road. Confronting people I love about something I don't like is not really something I do. Its really hard for me. I could get it into a new bank account or something but after thinking about it, the fact they are taking from me means they have dug into debt probably and things will get infinitely worse I feel like if they continue to use money they might not even have. And if I do that without telling them, they will know I've been seeing this activity. And I don't know what problems that may cause. I know a lot of this is my fault for letting this happen, but I just don't know how to confront them or what to do about this. I will also add that they do add money back into my bank account presumably from their checks at work, but the money they have paid back is not quite equal to what they have taken. The person I really want to talk to most about this (a grandparent), who has heard about it before, is going through a very very stressful situation right now and I don't want them to have to add this on top of that. Im just so stuck right now. i want to help them and I have tried but it just doesn't work. I cant force them to stop even though they really want to. they told me they don't know why they do it, and I've tried so much to help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gdxun3/parent_taking_money_out_of_my_bank_account_for/,1,5,1730107540.0

Day 320: To those struggling....Be your own best friend today instead of your own worst enemy tomorrow,"I've literally read 100s of posts saying I'm 25yo, I lost 40k and my life is over. You have 50 to 60 years left on this planet and your life is far from over. Your life is not finished over 40k. 

I understand the short-sightedness and was probably once a victim myself. 

But instead of beating yourself up thank your lucky stars that you even suspected a problem and considered addressing it at a young age. Your wisdom is phenomenal!

 You are paving the way to an easier life than I created thanks to my self imposed obstacles and self sabotage. 

Seriously, please do a 401k calulator, an investment calculator with what you can set aside, and realize what you lost is akin to skinning your knee on the 3rd grade playground. The addiction is telling you otherwise to keep you hooked.

Even if you're older, it doesn't matter. The best time to quit gambling was 20 years ago. The second best time is today. 

Take the distraction, the anxiety, the restless of gambling out of your life and success, happiness.....and just being comfortable in your own skin is so much easier. 

Let's all be our own strongest advote for the life we envisioned starting today.

I think I dont have a gambling problem but everyone says I have a bit of a gambling adiction,"My plan was using compound interest to bet all in at 1.05-1.10 odds during live.

During this last year I have lost many such low odds because im not following my strategy

I have still not lost any money im at +100€ right now.

The problem is that I have a motto that at minimum I need to place 1 bet per day and 2-3 per day during weekends.

There have been days where I could not bet during 1 day because I did not have time and I felt a but shitty because I lost 1 day of earnings.

So in my case how much of a gambling adiction do I have?

Forgot the most important part the plan was compounding bets until reaching maybe 5k on a 1.05, how would it be if all the bets I placed during a 60 day period were all won by a big margin?

Relapsed - 350 euros down the drain ,"Not long ago I was convinced that I can play small bets and control myself. I played 20 euros and could stop myself by not putting the 50 euros I had in my pocket into the slot machine. I was relieved that day that I’ve overcome the addiction. I was warned here that the danger is not over yet.

Fast forward, a few days ago I decided to play low volatility slots with high RTP rates, after all I could control myself, didn’t I? So I played 100 and reached 150 shortly. I was very happy. But then the machine stopped paying. Played another machine, didn’t pay well either. All of a sudden I found myself playing different machines. 150 euros melted fast. Went to the ATM and withdrew 250 more. Lost them fast enough. Thankfully the casino was closing and I had to leave. Paid for the taxi as well. Anyways, I am once again convinced that there is no winning in gambling, especially when you’re an impulsive type like me. 
I’m trying to forgive myself. If I listened to the people here - instead of chasing my loses forgave myself, I’d have those 350 euros in my wallet.

I started with small investments, filled with dreams of achieving financial freedom, breaking out of the rat race, and building a secure future. It seemed like the answer, a way to take control of my life.

But impatience got the best of me. By 2020, I turned to leverage trading, thinking it would accelerate my success. That’s when everything began to spiral. At first, it was about making money, then it was about chasing losses, desperately trying to break even. I kept thinking, “Just one more trade, and I’ll fix this.” But each trade only dug me deeper. Over time, it stopped being about the money at all and turned into a dopamine-seeking, mind-numbing cycle of highs and lows, losses and regrets.

I tried to quit before, but I relapsed again. I thought I could control myself, making just a small deposit here and there. But every small deposit became larger and larger. I’d go to the grocery store, carefully searching for discounts, buying the cheapest items, stretching every dollar—yet I had no hesitation throwing paycheck after paycheck into my trading account, knowing full well how quickly it could disappear.

The losses are always on my mind, a constant shadow I can’t shake. I’ve woken up in the middle of the night, panic-stricken, heart racing, covered in cold sweat. The weight of the losses hits me out of nowhere, and there’s no escape from the relentless regret. I’ve cried for hours, pleading to God for a way out of this nightmare, begging for the strength to break free.

Every day, I look at my wife and tell her how sorry I am for what I’ve done. I see the disappointment in her eyes, and it cuts me to the core. She trusted me, and I let her down, throwing away our hard-earned security for this addiction. In a desperate attempt to make things right, I’ve handed over all my finances to her, hoping that with her help, I can finally end this cycle.

It’s a strange and painful feeling, realizing how far I’ve fallen from the person I used to be. I was once a prudent saver, careful with every cent, planning for a secure future. Now, I’m trying to claw my way out of this dark place I was so easily pulled into, desperate to reclaim some part of the life I lost to this disgusting addiction. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gdhbi8/nightmare_please_wake_me_up/,16,16,1730052801.0
Day 15 ~ Decision to start over," I’m going to start over where I left life. 

For me that’s ~12 years ago (5 years after I started gambling). I dug myself in a deep hole and I have been surviving since then.

Now I’m going to start doing what I needed to do.

A second chance.

If I blame my past self for not doing what was necessary, then my now self can start over where my younger self dropped out. 

Like I have been awakend from a coma. I am going to forget about age. Age is just a number. I still feel young.

With the knowledge and experience I have now, I can give myself advice like talking to my younger self. A lot of us give advice to others that are younger so they can benefit from it, but they forget to benefit from it themselves. They act like their time has passed. 

You now know exactly how devastating gambling can be, so what should you’re younger self do about it? Do that. You can be your own mentor.

Regrets? Bullshit. If it was so easy to do what was necessary, you would’ve done it. You didn’t because it’s hard. It takes effort. Now sitting in regret is also taking the easy way out. Wallowing in self-pity. Like you are helpless victim. 

**GET THE FUCK UP**

When life knocks you down, you gotta come back harder.

Not Sure What to Do,"I'm 23 years old, and I feel like my life is already ruined. I have developed a gambling addiction over the past few months that has been consuming me. I'm a recent college graduate making \~65k a year, with student loans and credit card debt that I accumulated during college, but for some reason I am gambling thousands of dollars online instead of working towards paying off my debt. I've casually gambled for years, but once I discovered online gambling it became a full-blown addiction. I've probably spent around 10k since July on gambling, and no matter how big of a win I hit it doesn't seem to be enough at this point. I remember when I used to go to the Indian casinos before I developed this issue, and a $100 win would make me excited. Now, I can hit a $1,000 win and feel nothing because I know it's not even close to being enough to make up my losses. I see people post on this subreddit about dealing with this addiction for years, and it terrifies me to think that I may end up struggling with this for the rest of my life, never being able to get out of debt or buy a house due to gambling. I've self-excluded from sites, but I always just end up finding a new one. I spent my rent money this month on gambling and I'm going to have to pay it late now. Despite all this, I still want to gamble. How are you supposed to live like this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gd8zyp/not_sure_what_to_do/,4,6,1730029014.0

How did you cope.,"I hit rock bottom mentally I think. To a point where I don’t care anymore. Got 2.5k in debt. 
For me it’s just the fact that it will take years to actually save something like to save 2.5k debt will probably take 6months and than it will be another 1 year to save to like 5k I don’t know. I’m gambling not because of money in it self but I just don’t see the point in working and saving money anymore like even if I let’s say save money and go rent a house rent is like 1k a month than you just work and sit at home basically I don’t know I don’t see any vision of where work would actually take me. Gambling gives you false hope of quick fix I guess that’s why we gamble. I tried kill my self once . But was no where near mentally and financially that bad. Where now it’s first time ever I’m in debt and think I will keep drowning. Had already second plan for suicide. Got everything I need to execute but just day before on my last day at work people kept saying how they will miss me and we need to stay in touch. So something kicked in and prevented from going for it. So I don’t I know . I know one thing for sure because I already planned I now know how to do it too so it will always be in my head as an option.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gdb1ss/how_did_you_cope/,6,9,1730035983.0

2 Weeks Gamble Free,"Lemme start by saying I have been playing online slots for nearly two years straight aside from a few short stints of abstinence. Somehow some way, no matter how many sites I excluded from I always found a way to gamble until I cut the snake off at the head, then all of a sudden unless I had access to gambling sites based in Ontario I couldn’t use my credit card to fund the sites based in Cuaracao which were the only ones available to me. 
Here’s what helped me, going off a tip I got from someone on this subreddit I excluded directly from gigadat, the e-transfer company that most of these sites use for funding your account. 
Ever since then it’s been near impossible to get funds into a website to gamble with. This method isn’t a catch all but it sure has made it harder for me to gamble.
In the past two weeks I’ve been able to pay my bills, I’ve been able to treat my family to dinners out and toys and whatever, I’ve been able to fund projects I’ve been meaning to accomplish for years, put gas in my car, buy the things I want… For the first time in two years I feel like I can breathe. 
Also I’ve been playing a lot of Subnautica, that really helps stave off the cravings for some reason.
Thanks to anyone who reached out after my last post, I apologize if I stopped responding I often forget to check my messages on here.
I hope you all are also finding a way out of the darkness man, this addiction is a black hole and one of my biggest personal struggles.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gd1tjh/2_weeks_gamble_free/,8,3,1729998716.0

Help coping with losses ,"To keep it simple, I’ve lost approx. 40k over the past 4 years. Lost about 20k of it within the last few months. It’s been a progressive battle where I’ll stop for 3-6 months, and on a whim I’ll get back into it (primarily online) and it completely destroys me.

I make about 60k a year, and whenever im facing these depressive episodes after the fact, I dance in my mind around finding a higher paying job, finding a side hustle, or just trying to maintain my mental state until the loss doesn’t hurt anymore. I’ve never been to the point where I can’t pay my bills, or need to take loans to continue my personal life, although my consistent savings account balance of $20k+ over the years manages to dwindle by less than half. After tonight, once again, on a whim , $7k gone in the span of 20 minutes.

I suppose I just feel lost, and my sense of purpose feels rather lackluster, and I don’t know what to do with myself. This has been constant cycle since 2020, when the boredom of COVID began my gambling addiction. I suppose I just want to seek advice on how to cope with these losses, but also ways to potentially make this money back legitimately over the course of the next few years. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gd0l01/help_coping_with_losses/,12,6,1729994297.0
Please stop me,"I am a 23 year old man. I started gambling at an early age on websites that allowed you to deposit CSGO skins (items from a video game with monetary value). I remember stealing money from my parents to do so and it is to this day the most shameful memory i have. Facing financial difficulties in university i became a poker pro. This has been very profitable for me in the last two years, but there's a catch. Sometimes i gamble on blackjack, it is my weakness. God knows how much of my profits i wasted on this game. 
Today i lost 10% of my savings on Blackjack. I let myself get influenced by a breakup i am going through and went on tilt. I have been here before, saying i would quit poker for good but ending up coming back since it is my best skill. But playing poker keeps me connected to my other side, my gambling side. 
Poker is my passion but also my worst enemy. The strategic depth of the game fascinates me and i am quite good at it. But i cannot stop feeling disgust for myself for taking advantage of other people with the same problem i have. By playing this game professionally i directly support the casinos that i despise for destroying lives, families, futures. 
I HATE MYSELF! My parents have taught me ethics above all else and i apply these principles daily. I am a highly intelligent, empathic loving and kind person. I feel all of these qualities slowly slipping away, swallowed by the cold and pragmatic approach that being a poker pro requires. I used to love making music, chess and gaming. Now i never have time for them, because they bring me no income. My life has become a grind. My purpose has become making as much money as possible. 
I adress myself to people that are older and more experienced than me. Please explain to me why this career path is a dead end, why working on anything else would be more rewarding and...ethical. I know the answers but i cannot stop. I just feel it inside me, i can feel that i am making a mistake that i have yet to see what the real consequence will be. I want to be able to love again.  I want to stop being a piece of shit that steals people's money in a game of strategy and chance and calling it a job. Just because i can doesn't mean i should, right?
Please don't delete this post based on Rule #4, mods. Even though my situation is unique on this sub i am seeking help and support, same as everyone. I want to be a better man. I want to tell my father, he has always been hard working and ethical. I know he would be able to help me. But i am ashamed, scared, and a part of me knows there would be no turning back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gcz2y7/please_stop_me/,4,10,1729989180.0
Day one. ,"So today’s my second time quitting, but my first time being self excluded. I have vet blocker on my phone and no way to download a single app or visit a website for years. And I don’t live near a casino. I just wanted to come here with my day one experience. And to tell you you’re not alone. 

I’m definitely suffering from some withdrawals, I’ve had a headache all day, I took a long nap when normally I would be gambling. I loved just cleaning my house, taking a shower and sitting in my bed gambling. Wasted so much time and money of course, for months… but today I got so much accomplished, bought a new mop, cleaned my house, made a nice steak on the grill and enjoyed my gamble free life even if I didn’t feel the best. But I do miss it. I would be spinning right now instead of writing in here. 

I went and did all my money counting which I’m sure a lot of you understand. Like “I have this in savings, this in checking, here’s my debt, here’s my bills etc” and of course it looks wildly different than it did even just 2 weeks ago. I went chasing and chasing last week and lost $15K. Done that a few times over the last 6 months. But when I realized I was back to exactly where I started in April that’s when I finally had enough. I did not want to get myself to a point where I literally would prefer death. PLEASE stop gambling if you can’t play for fun and chase and chase. The house always wins. You will not get lucky. If you do you’ll chase that high forever and dump it back in. Your problems will NEVER be fixed by gambling. I regret nothing more than starting. And the person who introduced me plays like 20 cent bets and has no idea that I was literally depositing thousands and thousands I didn’t have everyday. I made that decision obviously it’s not his fault but as a person who’s never been addicted to anything in my life, I didn’t know that would happen to me. Until it did. 

Please stop. And message me if you need support. This is not something we can do alone. 

I literally have NO access to anything. I can’t speak for those who do crypto or stocks or sports etc I only did slots. So I know I 100% cannot get on anything even if I tried. And I truly think this will help me. And I hope it’ll help you. Please do it today. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gcybq8/day_one/,8,5,1729986783.0
How to win back your loses without gambling?,"- Set up an opportunity savings.

- Set up how much is your losses for e.g $2,000

Then, check your lifestyle... what are the things you want to sacrifice in order for you cut your expenses then transfer it to your savings?

Check whats the break even of your losses vs the opportunity savings

Use an app for this... Im using savings tracker in android and its free.

Then lastly look for a side hustle or a hobby that can generate additional income.

One whole year,"It has been one whole year now since I have gambled a single penny. It all started 2 years ago when I lost £1300 (GBP) in one night playing online poker. I was probably already down about £3000 total I had accumulated over the year which I had drained my savings account.

 This I know is a relatively small amount compared to some people but I work a minimum wage job. That money was everything to me.
I signed up to GameStop initially for 5 years that stopped the online gambling, best thing I ever did but would still visit the casino after work and bet small amounts. I soon stopped this as using cash seemed a lot more ""real"" and was able to talk some sense into myself. 
I was scrolling through my bank statements yesterday and realised it is officially over one year since I made my last bet. Just to let everyone know that it is possible to stop...

 Keep a positive mind set and be greatful for your good health. You can beat this...",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gckd9o/one_whole_year/,7,2,1729947035.0
Five years ago now,"Five years ago, I was strolling through the sun-drenched streets of Portugal, with a pocket full of cash and a heart full of dreams. Life was golden—limitless, really. I had this grand plan to escape the rat race, build financial freedom, and live life on my terms. But somewhere along the way, that ambition took a nosedive into something darker. What started as a harmless thrill in the stock market turned into a nightmare, pulling me down until I was barely recognizable.

Fast forward to today, and I’m trying to piece things back together. I’ve put on 30 pounds thanks to all the sugary drinks and stress eating, my liver isn’t exactly in top shape, and my energy has been replaced by regret and fatigue. The “what have I done?” moments? Yeah, they’re a regular thing. But, here’s the twist: I finally decided enough was enough. I’ve kicked gambling to the curb, and I’m working on rebuilding the life I lost along the way.

I’m taking small steps forward—hitting the gym, eating healthier, and chipping away at the damage bit by bit. And, here’s a new chapter: my wife is now the boss of our finances. Yup, she handles the money from here on out. I pay the bills, and whatever’s left over? Straight into her account. No more risks, no more impulse trades. This time, we’re rebuilding together, with some real guardrails in place.

Of course, it’s not all smooth sailing. There are days when the losses come back to haunt me, and I think about what I could have done with that money. I see friends buying houses, building their futures, while I’m still here, renting and reminding myself that this is a fresh start, not a defeat.

What started as a dream for freedom somehow became a cage, but I’m holding onto the hope that I can escape it for good. Gambling may have taken a lot, but it won’t get the last word. This is a journey back—back to health, back to stability, and back to a life that feels like mine again.

So, here’s a reminder to myself, and anyone else who’s struggled: you don’t have to do this alone. Sometimes, leaning on the people you love is the strongest move you can make. And every step forward is one step closer to a future that’s finally within reach.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gci1te/five_years_ago_now/,14,2,1729938373.0

What’s wrong with a little gambling tonight when he went to sleep. 50$. Won’t hurt anyone, right? If I lose, that’s it and we go to sleep right….

Nope. Lost that 50$ and deposited more to get it back obviously. Lost in a blink of an eye. And more. And more.. And more… And more… Jesus duckig christ.. I hate myself right now. That 50$ turned into a 4 digit number that I COULD NOT AFFORD TO LOSE. I wanna cry but I’m just numb right now. I fucking hate myself for it.

How do you stop chasing? ,"6 months of gambling ruined me. In my own ways. Not everyone is the same. I know it could be worse. I could lose my house, my family, have thousands of dollars in debt. I’m very thankful for many things that DIDNT happen in my addiction. But I’m struggling so much to be content with what I have. I self excluded from everything today… I have 0 access now. I live nowhere near a casino. 

But I’ve spent months chasing since a big win. Spent it all. What even is a big win when we just go back for more lmao 

Money truly isn’t everything and this addiction has such a hold on me. I just miss the days I could do 25 cents and sit there for hours on $200 for fun. That $200 turned into $5K a day (until all the $ I was up and down on was gone.) now I literally couldn’t stand the thought of touching my savings more, or hell cash advances and loans and really fucking up my life? No way. But I clearly can’t gamble for fun anymore because it has destroyed my ambition, motivation, and many other things mentally. 

I just want to sit in my normal life and go back and accept I’m back at 0 from April and I can now have a normal life. I’m young and have so much ahead. 

If you are recovering how do you stop chasing? How do you deal with all you’ve lost if you just kept dumping and dumping?

Day 14 ~ Socialize,"My therapist said it 10 years ago; put in more effort to socialize. I couldn’t. I was to stubborn. My ego was hurt. I didn’t need people. 

But I missed out on so many things just because I was so stubborn. 

**It was way easier to go to the casino and enjoy myself while I was also “making money”.**

I have been an idiot and it hurts to admit. 

34, never been in a relationship. Why? Because my ego told me I don’t need it. That women are disgusting anyway. My ego was hurt.

It’s just hard to change. 

And I thought money would solve all my problems. Maybe it would have given me a little more self-confidence. But gambling did the opposite instead. Took all my money and made me more insecure. 

It’s a bitter pill to swallow.

Not even wanting to swallow it and just wanting to go gambling again. 

Not stopping gambling means a possibility that not all was for nothing. That it’s not over yet.

While stopping means; game over; you’ve lost. You’ve lost 17 years of your life, no savings, no friends no future. 

I know it doesn’t have to be such a dark perspective, but it’s just hard to know things could’ve been way different and that you were the obstacle.

I might showing early signs of a real problem with sports betting. (Read with Caution),"NOTE: Read with caution, this can be triggering for some.

I am Male 22yrs old.
Here is some background info. Last week I lost $400 in winnings on various different soccer bets on teams and leagues I have never heard of before. I felt like a failure, that was my first time ever losing all of my money that I made betting, the only thing I had left was a $45 bet with a $545 payout on a 7-Leg BBall/ Football parlay. And about 2 days after losing everything I won that bet, and I felt on top of the world. 

The next morning, I wanted to continue this feeling of victory and triumph so I did my dummest and most reckless bet ever. I bet $250 of winnings on a 3-leg parlay of Chinese Basketball teams I have never heard of in my life, but I won $1.4k ($1175 in winnings). I posted on r/sportsbetting and about half the people there applauded me for the win and the other half said I had a problem and should stop gambling. 

I’m not gonna lie, $250 is a good amount of money to me and something I wouldn’t just take for granted but I saw the opportunity to multiply it and I took it. It paid off this time, but betting on something so stupid and random like Chinese BBall out of impulse might be a sign of a problem IDK. 

Granted, I did with drawl about $1.2k and used it to pay off ALL of my credit card debt (not from gambling) and I got my gf a present. So I used my winnings well and didn’t get more greedy. I make sure all my bills are taken care of and I put money towards savings, retirement, etc. But IDK if this is an early sign of a problem.


TLDR: I bet half of my winnings ($250) on an extremely reckless 3-Leg parlay of Chinese Basketball (Which I didn’t even know existed until I placed the bet) and won $1.4k. I used the winnings (1.2k) responsibly by paying bills and treating my gf to something nice, but nonetheless this bet was impulsive and extremely lucky that I won. I fear this is an early sign of me having a problem. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gc203p/i_might_showing_early_signs_of_a_real_problem/,1,8,1729883098.0

Don't fear the losses- fear the wins,"Because it gives you the false impression that it can be repeated.  It can't.   Everyone will be short of cash at times throughout their lives.  This is normal.  But gambling to try to make a credit card/loan payment or make a purchase will only make situations worse.  Don't even let this be an option.

In the long run, everyone who gambles loses money.  This is a statistical fact and don't let extreme anecdotes of extreme statistical outliers give you the impression this is possible for you.  Even if you think you have a system and play games that give close to 50/50 odds, just remember it's your bankroll against the casino's.  The house can absorb any swings and play indefinitely but your bankroll is finite.  Once you hit zero, that's it.

You may hate yourself and vow never to gamble again, but your lizard brain will remember all the momentary victories and you will justify that next time will be different...or you can stop while ahead.  Yeah, right.

I work in marketing and there is a very well-known fact about how people spend their money.  ALL purchases (or money spent) are emotional.  People will often justify their emotional purchases with a logical framework and justifications afterwards.  But the decision for where and what products to spend money on is inherently emotional.  This is the case with gambling too.

Day 1/ reflection of my situation ,"Did a lot of thinking yesterday about why I gamble what emotions I feel and some of the bad habits I have formed. Since I started gambling I have gained 30-40 lbs of fat. I’ve noticed when I gamble and lose and get upset I eat away the pain I’m feeling. Just yesterday after a terrible day I found myself eating waaaay more than I should have normally had. I workout still (around 3-4x a week) but I look terrible bc of how I stress eat. Yesterday I was brainstorming ways to turn my habit of gambling into healthy habits.  A big issue is I almost exclusively gamble at work (which is really sad) but I do it when I am alittle slow. I have a desk job so it is very easy to take out my phone and gamble. I’m going to challenge myself to be more productive and put the phone down and work. Last night I had a deeam about gambling and it sucked bc I don’t even want to think about that hell anymore. I’m going to change for the better. Diet hard, workout hard, transform my body and never gamble again. I have a long road ahead. I have 11k of credit card debt. I have to buy furniture and move out in January of 2025.

For Background: Nasa ibang bansa parent ko and living alone ako, nagwowork din ako everyday and ginogoal ko na paid ang bills ko muna bago maglaro. (which is nangyayare naman)

Today natalo nanaman ako ng 120k and pati yung partner ko natalo niya savings niya dahil pareho din kami naglalaro.

A new start,"Well as seen on my previous post I have relapsed after reaching my biggest milestone and that was 250 days. I've also been on a path to quit drinking and I also drank last night. Everytime I drink I don't necessarily gamble but everytime I gamble I do drink and although I don't think I should put my relapse at fault of my drinking, rather a massive risk factor for relapse, it does mean I need to seriously reconsider alcohol being removed entirely from my life to avoid gambling and to actually heal myself going forward.

Today is a good day to start my gambling and alcohol free journey together and so I will remain positive and keep moving forward as relapses are part of the process.

For safety I'll be calling my bank to see if they can put a restriction on withdrawals to gambling merchants and potentially transfer my money to my friends account.

Day 1 - today is a new day and I will keep positive that my journey will be nuanced.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gbas9h/a_new_start/,3,1,1729797297.0

How to get over gambling loss,"Gonna come clean. Just lost 800. To me 800 isnt a big nor small amount however i feel like shit knowing im down. I tried quitting once for a good 6months when i lost 1-2k but i started gambling again due to boredom. I have a toxic mindset when it comes to gambling so what should i do?

Here is why i say i have a toxic mindset

1. I like to save my money but sometimes i feel that the money is rotting in my bank account (i do invest and have money savings pots for my goals, holiday, gifts, gold etc) so i would just gamble for the thrill of it.

2. I came back from my losses before (I made back my losses multiple times before) so why cant i do it again? Thats when i start putting more money in.

3. The only times i consider quitting is when i start withdrawing from my personal savings account and i see my bank balance decrease (this is when i have a snap back to reality) and the shitty feeling feels worse. This creates a cycle of me wanting to gamble more to make it all back.

4. I also dont spend alot and would much rather deposit $200 into gambling  compared to a $20 meal. 


Honestly this post is more of a wake up call for myself but i dont think i can do it alone and am looking for online support/advice right now. 

Much help is appreciated 

Edit* I know this feeling is all temporary and that i can get over it since my pay check is coming in and i am able to put money back to my savings, however i just want to quit once end for all

Destroyed after 36 days ,"Well here I am again in this familiar situation. 36 days clean. Paying all my bills. Getting ahead on bills. Then today, just decided to go in and blow it all. I have a bill tmr and Monday that I can not pay now. My next paycheck is Tuesday so I am going to have to be a few days late on those payments. At the end of next month I need to be able to go furniture shopping with my gf and right now I have 30$ to my name. She’s expecting me to be almost done with the credit card debt I have around 2025 but I am no where near close. This fucking sucks I wish I could take my life and not have to deal with the torture of gambling ever again. I fucking hate this and I hate fighting so hard just to lose in the end. I am so deep in this hole I just want to lie down and give up. I don’t even know what to do about the two payments I can’t make. I’m ashamed to tell my gf she will leave me if she finds out I gambled again. I need help. I don’t have time to sit in on GA calls bc I work almost two full time jobs. Everyone thinks I’m rich and saving so much money bc of how much I work but really I am barely surviving and drowning in debt. I don’t know what to do I am so lost I need god to guide me and every time he does I cave in and gamble again and again. I don’t want to gamble anymore.

Mother has a problem ,"She has always had a problem but now that me and my brother are out of the house it looks like it’s gotten to be too much for my dad to handle. She’s spending their savings and now that they’re both virtually retired it’s gotten worse with the free time she has and the money they’ve gotten from injury settlements. 
They both worked a long time for the same place and my dad retired and my mom got hurt on the job a few years ago. so between savings, settlements, and some properties they own they should have what they need to cover expenses. However we recently learned that out of a $70k settlement they got earlier this year, she apparently already has blown through $50k of it. 

It’s not too late to set them up right for retirement and I’ve decided to pretty much force my dad to get a separate account to store the money in because if she has access she will spend it. We haven’t done anything yet but that’s the plan I’m about to layout for them. Up until now she has handled all the finances for my dad and he’s always just worked and given her the money. The only times he got involved was when he wanted to purchase some property. Good thing he did or else they wouldn’t have anything to fall back on. They can sell that and generate some cash to pay bills and clear out debt but if it’s left unchecked she’ll spend that money. 

Struggling with this and looking for any advice I can get. I’m hoping to hear that I’m doing the right thing but I feel like I’m taking away their independence. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gb5hm4/mother_has_a_problem/,2,4,1729784038.0
Coming clean tonight,"I’ve lost so much money from gambling and it’s something I’ve hid from everyone. Family, friends, and my partner. 

That’s changing tonight. I’m going to finally tell my partner about my issues in hopes of getting help. We have a child together and every time I lose money I feel the regret of letting my family down but then I turn back to try to get it back and end up worse. I can’t go through this pain anymore. The debt is through the roof to where it’s going to take years to get out of. I have no savings. I barely scrape by. I’m so scared to talk to her in fear she may leave but she’s been by my side through everything since we’ve been together and I hope she’ll understand my issues and be sympathetic and helpful. 

Any advice on how I should handle talking to her? Or should I just come out and say it? I just fear that if she decides she wants no part of it then I put myself in a worse spot mentally.

I am wrecked after gambling in crypto and don't know what to do now (seeking help),"I’ve been in the crypto space since 2017, always aware of the risks, ups, and downs. Over the years, I’ve won some, lost some, but it was all manageable. I wasn't really into gambling before, except maybe some sports betting here and there. This summer, I discovered memecoins on Solana (it's basically an online casino with tokens) and that’s when things changed. At first, I was cautious, playing with small amounts and managing my risks. But soon enough, I got caught up following KOLs on X and Telegram groups, which made me feel like I had a system, like I could control the outcomes.

Then, in September, I got laid off unexpectedly one day to the other. That threw me off balance completely. Just two days after losing my job, I sold a bag of a memecoin that I believed in from the start. The next morning, I saw that if I had held onto it, it would've been worth over $100k. That regret hit me hard, like I had lost a life-changing opportunity. I couldn't stop thinking about it, and it triggered a spiral of bad decisions. I started gambling more, chasing that high, telling myself I could make it all back.

At first, it was just trying to recover the loss from that one bad trade. But soon, it became all about chasing candles, hoping for a quick x10 to fix everything. The small wins fueled the addiction, and before I knew it, I was making reckless decisions without thinking. I was checking charts constantly, not sleeping, not eating properly, and making worse trades each time. I knew deep down that I was spiraling, but I couldn't stop myself. I convinced myself I was always just one trade away from fixing it all.

In the span of a few weeks, I lost everything: money of my life savings and  now in debt, with no job, and barely any hope left. I have to pay back €200 a month for the next five years, and honestly, I don't even know where to start. having no safety fund feels awful, and one is aware of this around me, my parents & GF still think I have my safety fund.

The worst part is that I can’t find joy in anything anymore. I used to love working out, hanging out with friends, do bike, read, do music, watching movies—now, I feel like I’m just going through the motions and crying every hour, I cannot concentrate on ANYTHING and basically feel super depressed. I can’t shake this feeling of being a total failure. No matter what I try, I keep coming back to that one trade I messed up, thinking that if I had just held on a little longer, everything would be different.

I’ve been applying for jobs, but it’s tough. I’m struggling to even focus enough to write a decent cover letter. Every day feels like I’m digging a deeper hole, and I don’t know how to get out of it. i never took medication in my life, is something exist for this? Eating healthy or going to walk as no impact.  
 Has anyone been through something similar? How do you rebuild after gambling away everything, both financially and emotionally? Everyone is getting married, having kids, good jobs and right now it feels like I'm stuck in this dark place and can't see a way out at all.

Any advice, support, or even just hearing from someone who’s been there would help. Thanks for reading.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gb4n9h/i_am_wrecked_after_gambling_in_crypto_and_dont/,23,25,1729781937.0

No one to blame but myself ,"Here I sit, drowning in my own pity with no one to blame but myself.

I had all the warning signs, I knew I had a problem. You guys told me what I had to do in previous posts but I just couldn’t listen.

I managed to claw my way from down 25k to only down 5k or so. But for my degenerate lizard brain that just wasn’t enough. 

I figured well I made 20k back the last 5k should be easy, boy was I wrong. Started off with a small 500$ deposit, then came the chasing. 1k depo 2k depo followed by several several more. 

Now, here I am sitting at work at 3am down 40 odd thousand dollars with no one to talk to. Not to mention I live 3 thousand km away from any family. 

It hasn’t even fully set in yet, I’m afraid when it does I may do something rash. Saved my whole work life to just piss it away like it didn’t even matter. Could’ve paid off my truck, could’ve put a deposit on a house, could’ve traveled the world for a few years. Instead I chose to gamble it away and be depressed for the next 5 years!

Gambling Virginia ,"I'M DESPERATE! 

Does anyone know the gambling laws in Virginia?
My husband has an extremely serious gambling addiction and I don't know what to do or where to turn . 
Ok so .. We own a business,  a very successful one and I'm truly scared for our future ! A year ago I found out that my husband had spent 35,000 in a span of 3 days at a Casino about an hour away from our home .. So upon finding out I told him I was going to leave and also ""out"" him to our adult kids, friends and family .. Who all have know for more than 5 years that he does gamble however NONE of them know the extent of it ..To be honest I don't think even I know the extent of it . He has so many ways to avoid me seeing exactly how much he is spending.  
 So he agreed and has truly stayed away from the casino,  but he started going to slot machines that were located in gas stations in the town we live in ... At some point last year Virginia banned the slot machines and I was so relieved.. Because even tho he wasn't going to the Casino anymore , the slots were becoming an issue ...fast .. 

My relief didn't last long because now there are these no name skilled game places .. I say no name because I have tried really hard to find out the names of these establishments and I can't .. They are in very small rented little places and there Is no signs,  I haven't seen any advertisements for these places and when I've asked other people who live near us they don't know either.  I should add we live in a very small town , and having any new business in town is a big deal ... but no one I've talked to or near by businesses know what the names of these places are.. and before anyone asks if I'm  sure this is really where he's going .. it Is I have him on a location app because of the nature of the business we own and for safety issues with the travel and our insurance requirements include location device on any automobile associated with the business and his truck is one of the main truck used .. So yes .. he's definitely at these shady places , I also went in to one of the places with him because he won a TV thru a raffle ticket event ... 
So when you walk in there are 4 arcade looking games set up.. and that's it .. nothing else ... just those machines and each machine plays a game and one is like a slot machine .. Because I was so curious and wanted to know how these games were played i put 20 bucks in a king Kong game and another with flying pigs..side note 
Anyway can anyone tell me are these places legal   if VA banned the gambling and took the machines/slots out of the gas stations then how are these places open ??? Is this legal ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gawyoh/gambling_virginia/,0,6,1729754707.0

"Advice, self pity everyday","Hello everyone, I’ve posted on here my story before. Basically, I am 23, and stopped gambling for the most part this past May when I turned 23. (Have gambled here and there but very small amounts and kept it in control— stopped losing my entire ass). In short, from October of 2023 to May of 2024, I lost a little over $50,000. It started with my original 12,000 savings, and then spiraled when I continually handed over every 2-week paycheck id get for months. In May, I realized i had to quit bc I was working for free. Since then I’ve saved about $30,000 , but owe about $6,000 on my car still. I’m here posting again today bc Idk how to not think of the money every single day, 24/7. In a way I have accepted my loss, but literally every single day I wake up thinking of that money and where I could and should be in life. A big thing for me is no one knows. I have support (family, GF) in my life- but I will never tell them. I can keep it to myself, but I guess I’d just like some advice how to move on. It’s in my head CONSTANTLY. I can’t escape it and it makes me feel like somehow I fell into this terrible reality of a nightmare. I have a good paying job, but it is commission based and my pay varies. I take home anywhere from 6,000-8500 a month, and on a rare occasion (only once) around 10,000. For background I work for a timeshare and we are going into slow season so the money probably will really slow down. I am in marketing and always #1 or #2 in the company- but our marketing position may be jeopardized soon because the marketing department as a whole seems to be failing. I can and will move up to sales as (was the goal the whole time) but am just scared it will take me a long time to see that money again. I believe I will be successful in sales- but should I stay where I am it will realistically take 6-8 months to take home another 50k due to Dec Jan Feb March being slower- and should I move to sales ASAP it would probably take about the same time because again it is slow season+ learning everything. Basically I hate myself because I will always feel like I am 8 months behind where I SHOULD be. I hate myself because I can’t buy the car I want to now. (Materialistic I know, but it’s a goal of mine and I threw it away when I could easily have it now). I hate feeling this way, I can’t stand how it feels to know I’ll always be chasing that money and that I threw that time and money away. Basically I came here to tell all my self pity story and how I can’t come to terms with my losses. Any advice always helps, and sharing stories.

My past 3-4 months of hell,It all started with small wins ranging from 100-500 a session then i started to wager more and more and on some sessions I would win 1000-2000 then all came crashing down one day when I was actually up 50k yes i wrote that correctly 50k but I did not withdraw and went on to not only lose that 50k but lost 97k more on that very day…… I literally wagered a staggering amount of 987k that day. I was devastated and all my so called winnings over the past 3 months I lost it all plus more!

LOST PHP500K IN JUST 6 MONTHS,"I'm not a fan of gambling since i know the end result once you are into it. I dispised it actually. But now at 34 I'm in huge debt because of online gambling.

 It all started last January this year, when I stumbled on an online casino  ad while browsing for online side jobs for additional income. It started with small bets like 50-100php then eventually started to deposit bigger amount to recover my losses and won it back just after days of playing which is equivalent to my actual losses. Since I was able to recover my losses, i decided to try my luck, to atleast gain a little from it, until i lost it all over again and repeated the same for months.

I was in a situation where in I actually saw my bets as numbers and not an actual money. I keep betting thinking even if i lose, at most, I'm losing what I won and and not my actual money. With that mind set, i found it easier to accept my losses, until my luck ended and I lost all my money. That's  the time i realized that what i lost were not numbers but actual cash so I started to desperately chase it back. i kept depositing in my casino account until I lost every savings we have and even  incurred a big debt from online loaning apps and personal loans being offered by the banks. Now I have to pay back more or less 800k debts in total including interest. 

Due to some circumstance that made me realize that I need to get out from this hell, I was able to stop it last july and never opened my betting account.

UPDATE: Broke my 6 month clean ,"Posted just over a month ago about breaking my 6 month streak after doing really well. I had a rough rough time and spent an awful lot of money. But the guilt was the worst thing about it.

Fast forward 30 days and I have not directly gambled since the day I made that post. Thanks everyone for your kind comments and some brutally honest ones that I needed to hear.

I am 32 days without gambling. No sports bets, casino. May or may not of indirectly gambled (video game case / pack) but I don’t count them fully as I don’t binge and get the addict feeling I do around actual betting.

32 days. Let’s have it. My trigger was alcohol and I had my first alcoholic drink the other night after 29 days and it was a really nice beer. In fact, I had 4. All just as good. It was a lovely evening with my girlfriend and her family. I didn’t even think about betting, not once. I hope this is something I can keep up. I’ll be having a beer this weekend also at a mates party & I hope my relationship with alcohol can be restructured, Saturday was a great experience. 

Thanks again everyone for the comments you have NO IDEA how much it helps and how much I appreciate people’s time and effort. Best of luck to everyone else in the same boat

Accountability - or not? ,"In the 30 days I’ve been recovering I’ve asked myself this question so many times, so I decided to see what do you think - where’s the line on our own accountability?

For example, I’ve seen and heard a lot of people justify stealing/hiding away money from loved ones because of this addiction. On one hand, I believe this is completely immoral and wrong, on the other hand - although I’ve never done it, as a problem gambler I can totally see how this could happen.

I’m constantly torn between “oh well this is a disease and an addiction and it makes you do crazy things” and “we’re all adults and are responsible for our actions”.

"Rule updates: Amendment to Rule #5, Addition of Rule #8","Dear community,

Please accept my apologies for adding yet another rule, but the sensitive nature of this community's content often requires strict guidelines and moderation to protect the safety of the members and integrity of this community. That said, I must announce some rule changes in response to recent posts/comments.

# Amendment to Rule 5, ""No Solicitations""

Whereas previously Rule 5 was titled ""No Solicitations"", the new title better reflects the original intentions of this rule, plus it responds to recent posts that have heretofore sat unaddressed.

**Why?**

For one, we received *some* instances of users misusing or misidentifying this rule, often misconstruing this as a rule about solicitations *of any kind*. The intention was to prohibit requests for money, since such a request constitutes a financial bailout. This wasn't meant to be about posts asking for upvotes, or soliciting services, or other interpretations of ""solicitation"". Truth be told, such posts are kind of *in bad taste* anyway, and there are more fitting rules that address this sort of thing (e.g. rule 1 re: spam, and rule 8 as described further below).

**So what now?**

Rule 5 now prohibits discussions on *financial bailouts* and *chargebacks*. Our reasoning is that both of these behaviors enable further gambling. Specifically, it perpetuates [the action cycle of disordered gambling](https://hhs.iowa.gov/media/11214/download?inline=). This does NOT mean that disordered gamblers are doomed to eternal loss, debt, or failure. It means that part of recovery means *fully assuming responsibility* for losses while protecting the gambler against the three ingredients that make gambling possible: Time, money, and opportunity. Recovering financially means a) putting forth honest effort (i.e. *work*) in a way that values and sustains your earnings, and b) using them towards healthy, recovery-oriented things (e.g. basic needs, family support, self-care, thoughtful gifts, and so on). These are the kinds of things that stimulate natural, healthy doses of dopamine and inspire a deeper, more sustainable sense of fulfillment.

It's difficult to provide a thorough explanation for this without entailing a full-hour lecture. But at the end of the day, *dems the rules*. Posts on this topic *may* be left up as a learning opportunity for the OP, but comments providing suggestions on how to obtain cash or how to pursue a chargeback ***will*** **be removed**.

# Addition of Rule 8: ""Offers to treat, coach, or otherwise resolve a gambling problem are prohibited""

**Why?**

This will be difficult sometimes to enforce, but I feel this is necessary - again to protect the safety of the members and integrity of this community. We've had some recent posts and comments from anonymous users who claim they can help others recover from a gambling disorder. The problem is that if the moderators of this community cannot verify whether or not a user is qualified to offer professional or quasi-professional assistance, we have to assume nefarious intentions.

*Reddit is full of bad eggs*: scammers, con artists, etc. We mods do everything we can to protect innocent users from the bad eggs. But we have neither the time nor energy to chase users to verify their qualifications. That's what licensing boards and other regulating bodies are for. Posting advice, recovery suggestions, and helpful comments are **fine**, but claims to be able to assist with gambling recovery without substantiated evidence of being a qualified recovery professional are tenuous if not harmful.

I understand that people who believe they are strong in recovery - or indeed those who worked the 12 steps and are seeking to help others - can be exuberant about their recovery and eager to help others. *I get it*. But posting something akin to *I know the path to recovery and I can help you too! DM me!!!* just looks shadier than a 200-year-old oak tree. If you really want to help others: jump on a community support meeting, offer to be a sponsor, comment on posts (without questionable offers, of course) or look into being trained as a gambling peer recovery support provider (if available) in your jurisdiction.

**So what now?**

**Licensed mental health** professionals, trained **peer recovery support** providers, and/or **other certified gambling recovery** practitioners should [message the mods](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/problemgambling) or reply to our Monthly Resource Post and request that you be added to our [Resources Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/wiki/index#wiki_resources), but please do NOT comment (comments will be promptly removed) or DM users to solicit services.

# Questions?

The rule changes above are expected to be enforced effective immediately. Those who wish to comment publicly may reply to this post. Those who wish to comment privately may [message the mods](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/problemgambling) with whatever thoughts/questions you may have.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1gaia0u/rule_updates_amendment_to_rule_5_addition_of_rule/,6,5,1729709575.0
"What Are Your Thoughts on the Term ""Degenerate Gambler""?","Hey everyone,

I wanted to get some thoughts on a term that often comes up in discussions about gambling addiction: ""degenerate gambler."" It’s one of those labels that seems to be widely used, but I’ve always wondered about the impact it has on people trying to recover.

The term itself feels rooted in a moral model of addiction, which essentially frames it as a personal failing rather than a complex psychological issue. From what I’ve seen, calling someone a ""degenerate"" seems to add more shame, which could make it even harder for someone to reach out for help and address the underlying issues that lead to gambling in the first place.

I’m genuinely curious to hear what others here think about it. Do you feel like the term accurately describes the experience, or does it do more harm than good? Have you personally struggled with the term, or found it a barrier to seeking support? I’d love to know your thoughts—whether you agree, disagree, or have a different perspective altogether.

Thanks for sharing, and I hope this can spark a respectful conversation!

How do i stop,"For context,
I started online gambling at 14. The only reason it stopped was because I lost $4,000 which was everything I had at the time. But since then it's always been off and on, with just small amounts (>$200). I am 18 now and recently, as of September it's started again. 

At first, everything was euphoric. I was winning money like crazy and felt like gambling was reliable and that if I just played ""smart"" enough I'd end up winning. I experienced a lot of major losses but i'd also win them back. I was getting lucky. My friend told me I needed to quit before I lost everything and that he knew I would because I would commonly talk to him about it and my winnings. 

But now everything's taken a turn. I'm down -$31,000. Every dollar I get now goes towards gambling trying to get that feeling, and all of my money back. I have nothing left anymore and find myself gambling amounts within the cents daily now. I've became extremely depressed and don't have any motivation for anything in life anymore.

I don't know what to do or how to change my mindset. Money has lost a lot of its meaning to me due to me being able to win large amounts so quickly. I'm just hoping for the next big win I can get.  

I'm not sure how to stop this pattern or fix anything in my life now. 

I know i'm young and it isn't that much money in retrospect but I can't accept it. I've had dreams where I won and finally got back in profit and woken up just for everything to be gone again.

How to stop gambling,"The best way to stop gambling is to stop other toxic things along with it as when you only quit gambling, obviously it’s not good to go back, but in your head (what your brain will think) you’ll tell yourself if you start again, you start again. But if you change more things along with quitting gambling, then starting to gamble again will be a bit harder as there may be something else you stopped which you find more beneficial in the short term and starting to gamble will make you start whatever else you stopped as well and it may make you think twice about starting to gamble again. Start a new habit or something. By doing habits, you work what’s knows as Neuroplasricity, which is your brains way of creating new paths in your brain to fall into other things. Think of it as a skil hill. The more people ski down one path, the more that path becomes “deeper and deeper” into the hill, and the more skiiers naturally fall into it staying in that exact same path. That’s the exact same way addictions in your brain work. The more you do something, in this case gamble, the more your brain is creating a stronger deeper path that will only be easier for you to fall into and repeat that task (gambling). How do you reset it? Just like on ski hills, when it snows, it almost resets it and now people don’t fall into that specific path as easy; with your brain, other habits you form and at the same time not falling into the path for gambling will make it easier for your brain to stop triggering the path way that leads you to gamble. It’s that simple. Start focusing your brain on other habits, on other things to quit, and your brain will slowly reset the path for gambling, and start focusing on other positive pathways that eventually over time will pull you much harder into them then the one for gambling.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g9zums/how_to_stop_gambling/,3,1,1729650304.0

Is it a problem if you can afford it?,"I've been gambling for about 32 years now...I just play slots...I can play decent blackjack but just don't like being around people.

My recent history:  My annual net income is $110-113K..Including Social Security payments. Other than the casino and buying physical media;I'm fairly frugal..No drugs...no eating out...no vacations...2020 car paid off,etc.

I was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer last October...Have had 16 chemo sessions so far and my last CT scan showed that my cancer is advancing...There is a possibility I could die from this. I will not go on a spending spree and max out my credit cards since I might die soon...nor will I use them to gamble with.

I don't have a lot of debt..No credit card debt ,just one creditor;which I will pay off in 30 months.  Though I could put my  disposable income towards the remaining debt;I've relapsed into going more and more to the casino lately...But the difference is that I cash a check from my Bank account and don't take cash advances  from my credit cards when there or before.Therefore...So far ,I can afford to gamble.

FWIW,I did GA in 1999...sincerely it didn't do much for me..I'm a contrarian when it comes to taking advice and encouragement from people...and the religious overtones turned me off completely. I was the traditional ""problem gambler"" then;that;s how I got in deep debt that I finally was able to control a few years ago.

So....Is it a problem if you can gamble without getting into debt?FWIW I have very little family,no friends and no relationships...I don't have to account to anybody.

I get a bonus from my job on the 15th that won’t leave me drowning anymore, but I know vigilance is the most important thing for me right now.

I started off using free bets with sign up bonuses. I told myself this would be the extent of my gambling endeavors.

Many people stay trapped in the cycle of gambling because they’re terrified of being found out. They keep chasing their losses, hoping to win back enough money to fix the situation and hide their problem. This desperation only makes things worse, pushing them further into debt and addiction.

The constant fear of getting caught adds immense pressure, driving the need to gamble more to “solve” the issue. But in reality, this approach only deepens the damage. When you finally confess, that pressure lifts. No longer feeling like you need to gamble to cover your tracks, you can start facing the problem honestly.

Coming clean isn’t easy, but it breaks the cycle. Instead of gambling to avoid getting exposed, you can focus on real recovery, with support from those who care about you. The secret’s weight is gone, and while the consequences may be tough, they’re easier to face than the endless spiral of addiction.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g9hvek/coming_clean_the_only_way/,6,1,1729602947.0

Day 11 ~ why can’t I just let money rest?,"When I have free time and there’s some money on the bank, the craving seems inevitable. 

Like why can’t I just let the money for what it is.

Conditioned to withdraw everything and risk it all on a game that will eventually take all the money.

Why don’t I take a lesson out of it, after all these times. 

Doing the exactly same thing, expecting a different result. 

Magical thinking. 

And even if I win money, then comes the next obstacle: restlessness of not knowing how to spend it asap. 

Eventuay leading to gambling again. 

The cycle that never ends. 

Having clear moments, understanding it all.

And yet; “let me get one more try”.

It’s not about trying anymore.

The body wants what it wants, a dopamine high. 

Manipulating the mind to convince yourself it’s okay to give in, “just one more time”. Every time again. 

Leaving no space for progress or improvement. 

Fuck money. 

Live life like money doesn’t even exist.

You don’t need more of something that doesn’t exist.

What’s your next move? Now gambling isn’t an option anymore?

We have no fucking idea. Clueless.

Reading a book.
Going to the gym.

Been there done that.

It all gets boring. It’s the same thing. We know what comes when we start doing it.

With gambling there’s no knowledge of what’s to come. It can go different ways. The uncertainty. The millions of possible slot combinations. It’s always exciting. 

It’s like trying a new thing every time, giving the same high as if you were bungeejumping for the first or second time. Not having felt anything like it before. But with gambling it’s not trying a new thing. It’s just seems and feels like it. A different slot, a different stake, strategy. 

That’s why it takes time, several years, for a gambler to take the decision that something must change;

The “wanting to quit” phase.
Not really wanting to quit, but wanting a different outcome.

Then, finally several years later seeing this can’t get go on and deciding to get help.

And even after that, we still have the craving.

Understanding it all, having seen it all, nothing that can excite you anymore.

But still wanting to do it. Conditioned. It’s a genius design that takes years to see through and in that time it has made you powerless. 

Just writing this down, made my craving go away.

It makes me feel like vomiting, what they’ve done to me. 

But staying strong this time. Fuck them. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g9ec32/day_11_why_cant_i_just_let_money_rest/,8,3,1729590592.0

"Male, 25. Relapse after 1376 days clean. ","As title suggests, relapsed after 1376 days. Was given an ultimatum by parents when I first begun my non gambling journey - to get clean, or leave. Took the former. Just under 4 years clean. Built the bank balance back up, managed to graduate, and never crossed my mind I’d be here again. 

I lost 7K in the space of a week. All on absolute nonsense. Racing, sports, just everything you can think of. All online. So never really felt the loss of excess money going through my hands. That’s what has got me before. And I felt emotionless during it. No realisation of what I was doing to some degree. I don’t know what triggered it. I guess because this addiction will never truly leave me. Now the realisation has hit and I look at my savings of only 10K left. I ripped through nearly half of that. I feel sick, disgusted, embarrassed. I have no idea what to say to my parents who have been the rocks for me through out all of this. I feel as if this will be the last straw. I have a job, and will have a stable income coming in for the foreseeable future, so a small, small reprieve.

My question is, what now? I’ve had therapy, got into my faith, resented what ruined my life all those years ago. Now it’s done it again. And I don’t know where to go or what to do. As I said, if I say something to my parents I feel they won’t understand, and that’s fair enough - I feel as if I’ll be let go and on my own. 

I’m not sure if this is a plea for help, or just a splattering of words of how I’m feeling now, but I just wanted to have something in the air I guess. Struggling to keep it to myself.

Lost it all... and money too,"Making this post so someone can hear me.

Up until April 2024, I was a casual gambler.  Rarely spent more than $200, maybe one or two times per year. 

In April while taking a break from mowing the lawn, a gambling website ad popped up on my phone. I thought hey what the hell why not. I mean it couldn't hurt. So I opened an account. Made a few small bets that hit. 

All of sudden, out of the corner of my eye I saw the two words that led to my downfall. 

Live Casino.

Since that day I have donated 220k to casinos. 

But what hurts the most is what I did to my family. My wife and 3 kids. I lost my house. Respect. Trust. Love. Everything. 

I'm now three months separated. Moved out. House sold. On the path to divorce. 

I fucked it all up. 

I sought help. I made promises. I made plans. 

But I constantly relapsed. 

I'm fortunate that my money from the house will cover my losses. And I'll have a small savings. 

I have a chance to be better. To make something out of my life. To do better for my kids. 

But that weight of what I've done, it feels unbearable.

Consumed By Sports Gambling,"Started gambling a little over 10 years ago and probably got to the point where I would acknowledge I’m an addict about 2-3 years ago. I feel like my every thought and attention is focused on finding/searching the next bet. I’m terrible with my phone and I can’t help it just needlessly checking my phone for scores or on my book looking for the next bet. The phone usage is what gets me in trouble with friends and family as I can never it seems like give them my undivided attention when a team I’ve bet on is playing. I always find myself sneaking away to a different room or the bathroom to place more bets / check scores when in social settings if games are going on. My wife will sometimes take my phone when we are out  and it’s a Saturday or Sunday with football because she knows what I will do and in those cases even though I can’t sneak away I find myself just only thinking about where my bets stand. If I suffer a bad beat or on a cold streak, I won’t sleep that well and find myself in an irritable/angry mood which is not fair to others because it is all 100% my doing.  For the most part I have practiced good bankroll management and unit discipline so from a financial standpoint it hasn’t put me in a bind (yet), but I know I have a problem that needs to be addressed as it probably is only a matter of time before it starts impacting me there. Is there a way to still enjoy the fun that comes with sports betting without it consuming me? I’ve tried to limit my bets to only games that I’ll be watching but that hasn’t worked. I just know I’m on a path where I’m going to cause issues with relationships I care about if I don’t make changes. Is quitting my only option?

Need help,"Hello everyone,

I'm new to Reddit and I'm here because I really need help. I'm a 25M and have been struggling with gambling addiction since 2019. It all started when I lost $10k while I was still in college. After that loss, I started gambling with smaller amounts, like $10, and managed to stop for a few months. But things got worse last year.

In October 2023, I had savings from my job, but I lost it all in gambling (roulette). Until then, I was debt-free, but after losing my savings, I took a loan of $2k on my credit card to recover the amount, and I lost that too.

In March this year, I took another loan of $8k and lost it as well. To repay that loan, I borrowed $10k and used most of it to pay the previous $8k loan, but I lost the remaining $2k in gambling again. Then I took a top-up loan of $4k and another $10k from an app, and I lost all of that too, plus my salary, which is only $1k per month.

I finally told my father and elder brother about my situation, and I promised them I would stop gambling. My father agreed to help repay my loans. But I relapsed recently, and in just 2 days, I lost another $4k. I've lied to my father about the full amount, and now, after calculating everything, I owe around $16k, and my total loss is about $30k.

I honestly don't know what to do. I'm still stuck in this cycle of thinking I can recover my losses, but I keep making things worse. I’ve already visited both a psychiatrist and a psychologist multiple times, but I keep relapsing.

Has anyone been through something like this? How did you get through it? Any advice would be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g8yeky/need_help/,5,5,1729538891.0

I am a Gambling Addict,"Hi guys. I wanted to make a post to capture my thoughts this past weekend. I am a gambling addict. I can never gamble again & keep healthy relationships or achieve my dreams. Other people can but I cannot and I have accepted that. I met my breaking point in July and began therapy with an addiction specialist. I have been 93 days gambling free and im proud of that number and want to continue in recovery one day at a time. 

I wanted to write more specifically about feelings of remorse, guilt & embarrassment over my addiction. When I’m escalated, it’s still very difficult to remember I am a good person with goals and dreams. It’s hard to remember that good people are gambling addicts. I hate how I lied to people I love and I feel deep feelings of grief over relationships I’ve lost due to my addiction. Even in recovery, I hate my past choices and want to grow in my future versus my past because I have 0 control over the past. However, that doesn’t mean my past behavior doesn’t induce feelings of shame that prove challenging to process in recovery. Thanks for reading my brief story and hopefully we can be empathetic to each other’s story. Thank you for your time and have a great day.

Gambling has started to impact me - vent,"27 single M 

I had around 150k networth, now its probably 120k.

Had to move back home mainly due to depression but gambling came with it and was the only outlet I had.

Over the past 2 weeks I've lost over $30k. Lifetime loses from gambling probably result in $50k.

Luckily, I have no debt and a very good job. And since I just moved back home I'll have no bills for a bit.

However, I feel entirely set back. It is difficult to work knowing how much I lost of my hard-earned money and how much time it is going to take to gain it back.

 I've been in a difficult period in my life struggling with depression that I think stems from male loneliness and lack of self-confidence. I strongly believe I gamble in large amounts and obsessively because it is the only source of dopamine I can get right now. 

I try to tell myself that losing 30-50k can be a onetime mistake in the grand scheme of life but its hard to be OK with that loss when my life seems to be spiraling out in other aspects. 

I think if I can make some changes and tackle this depression problem it will also fix gambling. I've excluded from the apps in my state but betonline still works. I don't think I will go further but I don't want to relapse.

I also think I need to stop focusing on the monetary loss and focus on the important changes I need to make to my mind, body and health.

Need to tell my wife,"I’ve had a gambling addiction for 5 years now. I’ve been married to my wife for over 2 years and have a 6 month old baby. I have always had a gambling addiction, and would lose thousands of dollars at a time. I’ve been able to quit for extended periods at a time, but then out of no where I’ll gamble again. 

I lost 125k on online casinos from September to April, and then stopped for 6 months. I excluded myself from all online casinos, and I was doing great, had a plan in place to to payoff my debt and was making great strides, I just hadn’t told my wife. and then This past weekend I was at a bachelor party and lost 4500 at the casino. I am so ashamed of myself, I can hardly think straight enough to work. I have not told anyone that I’ve lost this money, and my wife doesn’t even know I was gambling, nor that I’m in this debt. I’m now currently 105k in consumer debt, and have a plan still to pay it off in 24 months. I just feel like the biggest POS in the world. 

I need to tell my wife, I don’t know how she is going to take it. She has all the reason to divorce me, and I’m just so ashamed and scared I’m going to lose her, and my daughter. I don’t wish this upon anyone in the entire world. I plan to tell her everything, I just don’t know how I should do this. She’s been so stressed out lately with our baby and other stuff in our life, I don’t want to throw this onto her also. I would rather myself have to live with the stress and not put it on her, but I need her to know so I am not lying to her anymore, and need her to hold me accountable to not gamble.

We have separate bank accounts so she doesn’t know. I pay all the bills and then she Venmo’s me for her half, and I’ve never missed a payment on anything. I don’t want her help financially to help pay this back, although it would be quicker. I want her to control everything. Most importantly I want to get this weight of my chest of keeping this from her. I don’t wish this feeling upon anyone in the world.

Why did I go to 4 different casinos today?,"A year ago, I never could have imagined that I would have done something like that.

That’s right, 4 different casinos today alone. 


I self excluded for life from all of them and have never even gambled in them before. I self excluded from my main gambling place last week, now banning myself from the rest. I am putting the barriers in place for a better today and a better future, and just for today, I am not gambling. One day at a time. I am trying to take not gambling as serious as I can! 

My experience has shown me that I have to give my addiction the respect it deserves, or I am going to have a VERY bad time. 

Are you respecting yours?",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g8gpxh/why_did_i_go_to_4_different_casinos_today/,13,6,1729481820.0
Keep your paychecks at 100% power,"When you took the job you have, or negotiated your salary, you decided it was an appropriate amount to make for the work you do.  

If later your boss or manager explained that you were going to make 20% less, or 40% less or 60% less based on some random series events that you cannot control, you would be outraged and feel protective of your hard earned money.  

Start to see that always throwing away that amount to gambling is much more harmful than the ""entertainment"" value it provides.   

Once you see gambling as the continual money-suck that it is, you can see that by not losing that 20% or 40% or 60% every time, you are ahead by that amount in your real life bank account.   

I am used to reliably lose at least 50% of my pay to gambling, more at some points in my life. All to possibly win back some of it. A portion of the amount I would have had if I never put it into gambling. Ridiculous.   

You can build a normal life on 100% paychecks. You can dig yourself out of debt on 100% paychecks.  

Anything else is a voluntary donation to an industry designed to take your money.. See it for what it is, and refuse to participate any longer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g8fkb6/keep_your_paychecks_at_100_power/,41,6,1729477909.0

"Day 313: it's exhausting to be enslaved by the next snap, spin, or card laid down. Be the master of your own destiny ","It will always be ingrained in my mind that once that bet was placed I was a helpless prisoner with no control over the results. 

I was not sitting on the bench, and the coach was not going to put me in the game! 

Once my sports bet was placed, I had to live with consequences out of my control. It was too late to retract that bet. I could only watch and suffer for 2-3 hours. Then chase my loss and make things worse.

We are better off embracing life in the real world where mistakes can be rectified more easily. You said something hurtful? Apologize. You made a mistake at work? Admit it and stay more focused. 

In life we alone are in control, we can make mistakes right, and we never try to fix mistakes by doubling up on what we did wrong. 

Stop feeling helpless, being at the mercy of fate, and letting random outcomes determine your happiness.

I did it again I posted this a couple days ago was ok for a week and now yesterday I gambled my whole paycheck in 2 days. The thing I hate the most about myself is the fact that I take money out of my credit card everytime I pay a balance I'm not moving anywhere with my debt its just a rinse and repeat fkin hellhole cycle. GG....this is a never ending cycle for me holy shit. I feel like im wasting my life paying my debt off and just chase for that big hit but in the end im just putting myself deeper. I have to start thinking to myself that 26K is doable with my salary but i just dont know how to budget it properly and accepting that ill have 0 savings for over a year and some

I keep telling myself the day I lose I will stop gambling but for some reason I still go back. Maybe cause I work night shifts at home and have nothing to do and get my high off so I resort to gambling. I took out a loan to pay off all my credit card debt...and guess what all that debt came back cause I took out again from my credit cards after it was all paid off from my loan now I owe an excess amount of $10K in loans... absolutely disgusting behaviour. My life's pretty boring I have no car,no gf, live with my parents and just can't find fun in life rn. I make 64K/year but I just feel like I'm wasting my years of my 20s just paying off debt with no investments and $0 savings. Like it's fkin sad having no assets living rent free with nothing at my disposal. How do I go about paying this off as fast as possible and just stopping all together

715 days gratefully without a bet,"Today:  
·       I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

·       I am grateful to admit how hard it is to unconditionally love and accept who I am.

·       I am grateful to see how much inner turmoil was stirred up when I finally accepted yesterday that I needed to start a food journal again to help regulate my food intake.

·       I am grateful to see how long self-loathing and hatred have dominated thinking and mental activity over simply just admitting that I need help in any area of my life.

·       I am grateful for this morning’s realization that this stubborn inner resistance to accept and love myself unconditionally, this doubt that I’ll never be good enough just as I am, this aversion to accepting and maturely handling feelings of vulnerability inside, these are all what I felt strongly when I was in the throes of addiction, and what I’ve felt inside for a very long time.  

·       I am grateful for growing faith and acceptance of what is real and what is illusion– that all of this, especially what’s going on inside, it will all eventually change. It always does, it’s just not permanent, none of it is.

·       I am grateful to see that this doubt and aversion and denial and self-hatred, it’s not leading me towards a life of serenity and peace. This voice inside thinks it is protecting me from pain and suffering by thinking and regurgitating all this so often, but it’s just creating more unnecessary pain and suffering instead.

·       I am grateful to see each day that none of this is me. There are things that have nothing to do with me that are causing these thoughts, these emotions, the voice I hear inside, to appear.  Chemicals, electricity, genetics, all of it. I know I’m not them, I’m the one who is experiencing them.

·       I am grateful that the antidote to this doubt, to this inner restlessness and remorse, this ill-will towards myself and others, it’s acceptance, patience, and faith.

·       I am grateful for this journaling for helping me process what’s going on inside and both understand and accept the way things are.

·       I am grateful for the opportunity today to accept and love myself and life unconditionally. I may not get it right the first 1000 times, but I have faith that I’ll get there eventually. One day at a time.

Chronic pain makes me want to gamble,"Unfortunately, I have a spine injury (plus other injuries/surgeries) that has left me in chronic pain for 12 years. I've seen countless MDs and neurosurgeons to no avail. Basically, my only treatment options are a double blind placebo study for stem cells in 2025 that could take three years, seek out artificial disc replacement surgery in Germany, or keep living in pain. 

This situation has heavily effected my life (loss of job, career, education, relationships, etc). I have been denied SSDI. I've been denied pain medication other than NSAIDs. I currently am unemployed and live in my car. Thankfully, I have some money (inheritance+savings) I can live off, of but recently I have started gambling. I won X amount utilizing Sportsbook promotional bonuses to leverage my odds of winning, but recently gave Y amount back. I have a strong urge when in pain + depression to just gamble all my money on one roll of the dice if you will. I know this isn't healthy, but I feel trapped in an existence I no longer want to be in with no way out. 

Can any of you relate to this? Do you gamble as an escape from reality? Do you ever think about risking it all to try and change your life circumstances that otherwise seem unchangeable?

I guess this is a vent, but also looking for advice as I can sense this is headed in a bad direction and trying to get out ahead of it. Anything is much appreciated. Hope you are all doing well.

714 days gratefully without a bet ,"Today:

I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

I am grateful for everything the world provides and the lessons it gives me each day. 

I am grateful for the choice to listen and reflect on these lessons and realize the truth of the way things are, or to not and continue living in ignorance and delusion. 

I am grateful for the book I’m reading and it’s lesson that a culture of gratitude and selflessness naturally breeds serenity and peace. It’s not a belief, it’s an observation of the way things are.

I am grateful for time with therapist yesterday, and his reminder that underlying my gambling addiction is an avoidance of emotional intimacy with others, avoidance of showing vulnerability and being honest about flaws and imperfections and opening myself up to potential negative judgement from others.

I am grateful that he also reminded me that what others think is their business, not mine. I’m not in their heads to know what they’re going through, and they’re not in mine. That’s reality. 

I am grateful for the lessons of parenthood forcing me to confront what’s been brewing deep inside for a long time. 

I am grateful that this is the path I’m on now, not the path back towards self destruction that leads with placing that next bet. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g7iowa/714_days_gratefully_without_a_bet/,10,2,1729371913.0
All over $5500 (tw: domestic violence),"I just ""fell down"" a rocky cliff on a walk with my family because I ""borrowed"" $5500 (she logged into her bank account from my laptop and saved the password and I etransferred the money to myself) from my brother's wife and lost it and more and they found out while we were hiking together.

I don't drink, don't smoke, and had been clean since 2019, but I was dumped and spiralled and had to move in with my brother and thought (did I really think?) I could get enough money to move into my own place. Obviously I did not.

My little brother, his wife, and my father, and they're all okay with me being pushed down the side of a mountain.

So I guess I'm okay with it too.

Ready to Quit Gambling for Good? I’ve Been Where You Are—Let Me Help You.,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been exactly where you are—stuck in the depths of gambling addiction, feeling like I was trapped in a never-ending cycle. It wrecked my life, drained my bank account, shattered my relationships, and made me question my own worth. I’ve felt the anxiety, the shame, the constant desperation to chase back what I lost. I was in hell.

But here’s the truth—I got out, and you can too. It wasn’t easy, but I’m living proof that it’s possible. I turned my life around, and now I help others do the same. If you’re serious about quitting and can’t do it alone, reach out to me. I’m not here to charge you some crazy expensive fee. I’ll build a program specifically for you, hold you accountable every step of the way, and be there to guide you through the dark moments.

This addiction doesn’t have to ruin your life. I know it feels impossible to stop, but you don’t have to do it alone. If you’re 100% ready to take control and you want to commit to real change, I’m here to help. You can check my posts and see that I know what I’m talking about—I’ve lived it.

If you’re ready to fight back and finally end this, message me. Let’s get your life back together, one step at a time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g7eqr0/ready_to_quit_gambling_for_good_ive_been_where/,3,4,1729360913.0
Waiting for That Withdrawal? Good Luck—You’re Playing a Dangerous Game,"Most compulsive gamblers can’t wait for their withdrawal without gambling it away. What often happens is they start thinking, “I’ll just play a little until the money hits my account,” and before they know it, they’ve lost it all. And then the cycle continues—they deposit more money, chase their losses, and dig themselves into an even deeper hole.

Most of the clients I treat make this exact mistake. They believe they can wait, but the moment that urge strikes, they fall right back into the trap. You do as you want, but there’s a 90% chance this will happen. Right now, waiting for that withdrawal might feel like the right move, but that urge to gamble in the meantime is incredibly strong. If you don’t close that door now, the risk of losing everything—not just financially but mentally and emotionally—becomes nearly certain.

It’s not just about that one last withdrawal. It’s about stopping the cycle for good. Ask yourself: is it really worth the gamble? If you close the account now, yes, you might lose a bit of money—but you’ll win back control of your life.

Australian Gambling Meetings,"I hope this is ok to post, I just wanted to reach out to Australian problems gamblers with an invite to joint some non GA sessions. 

I was in GA for a few years, mainly online and a few face to face sessions however I found the rigidness constricting and the religious readings not really for me. 

I left for a while but when I left I lost the support and returned to gambling. I decided to start hosting some smaller sessions and they have been really rewarding. The group is not large and am hoping to meet some new faces. 

The sessions generally run on a Wednesday, Sunday and Friday at 8pm Sydney time and are restricted to people in Australia via invite only.

Feel free to send me a message and we can have a chat on WhatsApp. 

Its a given but worth mentioning, there is no cost or hidden catches. Just a GA alternative that Australians don't really have.

Relapsed and back to zero,"Hi all

  
Just sharing my experience tonight as I can't really share it with anyone in my personal life, haven't really gotten back on my feet again properly since my big gambling binge years ago with rent, bills etc. making it hard to save but last night I made a impulse purchase that I somewhat regretted which cost 30 euro, as I was feeling buyers remorse it's like the old me's way of thinking came back ""one hand of blackjack and it'll be like we never spent it"" which before that point and after is obviously a very stupid way of thinking, I knew this 24 hours before relapsing and in the immediate aftermath but somehow in that moment in time I was able to find the one online casino I hadn't permanently self excluded from years ago and deposit 30 euro

  
Crazy how the mind works, either way I obviously lose that blackjack hand, at this point I should have went straight to the self exclude section but instead I deposit another 30 euro, lost again. Then 20, another 20 and well if you've been on this sub for any length of time you know how it goes, once it was over and I regained my sanity I self excluded from this website. Luckily I only had 180 euro in my bank account at the time so in the grand scheme of things not a life changing relapse, got 20 euro to last the next 4 days but will be fine, if anything I'm happy it happened now while my bank account was low instead of a life changing relapse when I get back on my feet again and have proper savings again

  
Moral of the story is to recognise these thoughts for the insanity they are before acting on them and of course never gamble because it will always end the same",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g70pm5/relapsed_and_back_to_zero/,2,1,1729310588.0

Unable to think,"I have been posting to seek help as someone related to a problem gambler. A few things have come to light and I do not know what to make of it.

My brother has been an addict since over a decade now. The addiction gradually intensified and many acts were committed to fund the addiction. Corporate credit card was swiped and then to pay it back, multiple loans were taken from friends and family members. Then in a very short period of time when we were trying to process what was happening, a colleagues credit card was swiped (don’t know if it was stolen or if the colleague consented). Now the colleague’s parents have gotten involved. The addiction has skyrocketed and these illegal acts has made us all lose sleep. Can someone explain why this happened? Is this a deeper addiction than what most people experience? 

How do we manage this? I have been reading a lot of material including the resources provided in this channel, but unable to come to a conclusion, unable to understand what we should and shouldn’t do.

"Day 311: Redirect your ""gambling balls"" towards positive outcomes ","Fearlessness can be an awesome trait when pointed in the right direction. 

We didn't do that however when we gambled. We decided we would fight a battle that no one wins. Gambling is truly Custer's Last Stand. But those soldiers are dead and we are still alive! 

Use that fearlessness, stubbornness, and intestinal fortitude to your advantage rather than to your demise. 

Apply for that job or promotion that you truly deserve, do some financial planning towards a house down payment, ask that girl out that you would afraid to in the past.

When I gambled I was money hungry. I gave into my baser instincts. Now I'm evolving into being success driven. Money is a welcomed benefit of my efforts, but it does not define me as a human being. 

Use your God given traits to your advantage, and they will lead you to contentment, inner peace, and self-actualization.

DAY 1 - Coming clean to my parents has potentially saved my entire life.,"I'm 23m and gambling for these past two months has led me to rock bottom. I'm around 20k in debt and was up around 2k today then went on a losing streak and lost my last 3k. There are no chasing losses when you're down thousands. Only if you have unlimited money (which I don't).

That was when I decided to text my mum and call her. I cried the most I've ever cried in my entire life, I told her everything and that I needed a way out and I wanted just to stop gambling altogether. To give context, my mum is very strict and upfront and I was expecting to get shouted at to the moon and back however that is not how it went. She didn't yell at me, she didn't even berate me or tell me off for what I did. She told me that she was glad that I went to her for help and that she would always be there for me no matter what.

She then offered to pay off all my high-interest debt, under the condition that I would never gamble again. I then signed up for GAMSTOP and currently looking at apps that block gambling on my phone and have put blocks on gambling on my banks. 

I love my family dearly and I am so grateful to be in a position where my family can support me in a time of need like today. I feel like a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders but I feel such disappointment and guilt that I've had to borrow so much money from my parents who aren't even well off and work their asses off every single day.

But I am not going to let this happen again. I won't let this evil take any more from me. If I didn't come clean to my parents today, give it another month and I would have been in financial ruin. This is day 1 of being clean and I intend to leave all this behind me and be a version of myself that my parents will be proud of.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g6v20z/day_1_coming_clean_to_my_parents_has_potentially/,3,11,1729292205.0

Can we please make a group somewhere (not discord) on whatsapp/messenger/telegram (any suggestions are welcome) I'm sure this won't fix our issues but would most definitely help some of us when feeling the need to gamble, rather chat or talk about it for a few minutes and I'm sure some of us would change their minds, something easily accessible from our phones just to swap from the tab/app with casino to the chat and talk there for a few minutes...

Sucked back in and learned a valuable lesson. Feeling free ,"I was about 200 days free of betting on sports.. felt great. Life at home was great. My stress and anxiety pretty much vanished. Blood pressure was lower and everything was great….

Until football season started. My weakness every year. And once I got that itch again I couldn’t stop. For the past month and a half I was wagering pretty much every day with no control. I noticed my anxiety and panic attacks started coming back in. I did not feel safe in my own body almost I didn’t know who I am. I deposited a few separate times and today I need to get back on track to where I was. Taking years off my life with stress and anxiety just is not worth it. The interesting part is I don’t care about the money. How much I win or lose. It’s just the feeling of placing and winning that next bet. The number in my account doesn’t mean anything to me. Could be $5 could be $5000. Just continue to chase loss after loss until it’s down at $0 which is where I am today after a heart breaker last bet last night with the Yankees losing in unbelievable fashion. 

The funny feeling I am feeling now after waking up is a sense of liberation. My mind freed from all the madness and anxiety. Part of me is happy that I lost. This bout back in the gambling world teaches me another lesson. No matter how little you deposit it’s never worth it. Just enjoy sports for what they are and the amazing games to watch and experience. It is never about the money you will lose no matter what. Just stay far far away from that deposit button..

I could do something I guess. I could die. ,"I have terrible gambling addiction. I am in debt around 15k in the bank and around 2000 from debt collectors. I do not have any money saved. I gambled everything I ever got, but that is truly the only place where I feel actually happy. I have anxiety and depression since I was 15 after some traumatic incident. I tried to treat it so many times but nothing helped, ever. Tried so many different ways. I have no real friends, broke up with my girlfriend recently, got a new job couple of weeks ago but they can fire me anytime they want which I really fear. No relationship with my family, my parents are separated since I was a baby and they hate each other. My mum has other family and never calls me, when I asked for help she started insulting me and told me that I am worthless. No relationship with my dad at all, he does not care for me. I am really thinking if life is testing me but at some point I really felt that someone (read life) is just telling me to kill myself, and that it is enough. No car, no family, no friends, job that I really fear of losing due to debts, I do not have anything, really. Feeling so fucking terrible and worthless every day, I cannot take this anymore. I am only 23 but damn.. nothing is working for me nor will anything change as nothing good happened for me for a long time. I keep praying that I do not wake up. I literally reached the bottom and will kill myself right away if I knew that I will 100% not survive by accident.  I pay rent so not living at my place. Should I just fucking do this already, kill myself and stop this madness? I do not know anyone that is in even similar problems as I am. This is fucking insane and I should not live anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g6d4dc/i_could_do_something_i_guess_i_could_die/,14,34,1729239483.0

I have a hundred dollars in checking as of now. Waiting for my second deposit to come in. Most likely have to take money from my savings to accommodate for this week because I have to drive to another city to attend my nephew's birthday.

Outcome 2: you end up killing yourself because you can’t deal with the financial stress and shame that YOU have brought on yourself. Don’t believe me? Gambling addiction has the highest suicide rate out of any addiction.

Competition Sites,"After coming clean to my family about my gambling problem (online slots) accessing over 7 different accounts with different providers I joined gamestop and was instantly barred from every site. It was a great help!

However what it doesn't stop you accessing is competition sites that run similar to raffles. If you are allocated a specific ticket you can win instant cash and still be in for the final prize. The amount of money I spent chasing these instant wins! I did win here and there but nothing big. One time I even won £1000 amazon voucher or £900 cash, I have 4 kids why did I not take the voucher??? Of course I took the cash and then spent alot of it back thinking I'd win maybe the £5k draw. Doesnt help when part of these sites they also encourage you to join their FB page where everyone posts their wins every 2mins. The thing is it's clear to see the odds are not in your favour and the amount of money the owner makes off every competition is ridiculous!

I have since cancelled my accounts with them as it is so easy to get carried away.

Lost everything again ,"Hello all, I am an addicted gambler and once again have lost everything. 

In 2023 I got into gambling small bets on online casinos and gradually started my way up to big bet sizes . I was hooked on the fact that I made 10x more than my salary in minutes and I made a lot of money back then from gambling my peak was withdrawing a 30k cash out at the time.

Eventually I went on a dry streak , lost my job in the midst of things and when my wife found out and we divorced .

I lost everything and went back to my parents house . I got myself into therapy and did 1 year sober of no gambling but still didn't have a job until 5 months ago . 

I stupidly started gambling again about 3 months ago because I was employed but then I got laid off and in the dispair of the thought of not having enough money to move out of this hell hole ( parents house ) I started gambling for big wins but ultimately zeroed out my bank account.

I am sick to my stomache and feel like killing myself for all the progress Ive done just went down the drain in a few days and I don't see a way out of here anymore.

I have no one to blame but myself and am now spiraling down in depression again. I have nothing to my name. I sold all my electronics for cash to gamble and nothing in my bank account to back me up and now all my bills are late and going into debt again .

I really wish i never got introduced to this devils game , I wasn't wealthy but I valued my money a lot more and it was honest work .

Day One,"I have been a compulsive gambler since I was 18 (36yoM) and I have had my fair share of peaks and troughs with gambling. I earn a good salary now with disposable income and I have lots of money spare. I've noticed that my gambling is getting worse. I celebrated a £1500 cashout at the start of the month which made me feel so good, however it wasn't long before I started to rationalize that I was £1500 better off that how I started and that **even if i lost all of it**, **i wouldn't be in a position any worse than I was before.**  
  
Skip forward to today and I realise that **I have put all of the money back in, plus what I had at the start of the month, plus selling personal things that are dear to me to raise extra cash**. Enough is enough. 

***I am taking a vow from this day to stop gambling any more***, in a way, i'm creating this post as a negative reminder of how i have been feeling the past few days,   because when you are on a high it is very easy to feel like you are in control, when you are at your lowest, gambling gives you comfort that you might get back to the way you were feeling a few days/weeks/months ago. It's only temporary. When it gets to a point that you are not even gambling for profit, just to 'get your own back' on the house. It becomes clear we are addicted.

I have self excluded from dodgy crypto casinos and my UK GamStop will remain in place, even though it is due to expire.

Gambling addiction in a nutshell,"Gambling addiction happens because the brain traps us in a cycle of chasing the high. When we gamble and win, dopamine floods our system, giving us that rush we crave. Over time, it’s not just the win we want—it’s the thrill of the risk. And here’s the hard truth: even when we’re losing, we don’t stop. We think we can outsmart the system, that one more bet will fix everything.

But the more we chase those losses, the deeper we sink. It’s not about the money anymore—it’s about the feeling, the desperate need to get back on top. The brain tricks us into thinking the next bet will save us, but it never does. That’s the vicious cycle. We fool ourselves into believing we’re in control, but we’re not. The odds are against us, yet we keep playing because we’re hooked on the idea that this time will be different. But it never is. That’s the truth we have to face.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g59cvh/gambling_addiction_in_a_nutshell/,17,4,1729110896.0

Chasing losses is the worst thing you can do. I will try to remind myself of this when I think about gambling the next time.,"There is NEVER such a thing as ""just a $50 depo"". Before gambling, I would say to myself, ""just $50, and if I lose it it's fine, I will not play anymore."" But that's NEVER what happens. I will literally drain my bank account trying to get that $50 back. 

This is the thing that's hurting me the most. I could have $500 in my bank, and never in my life would I think about depositing all of that at once. However, I absolutely will deposit all of it once I lose the first $50, and the second, and the third... 

This shit is the most harmful habit of mine, and I will absolutely remember this when I'm thinking of ""just a $20"" depo next time. I wanna hammer it to my fucking head. Once I make that first depo, my whole bank account, everything I have, is on the line. So from now on I will focus on this, whenever I'm thinking about playing again. I never wanna play my account empty again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g560zc/chasing_losses_is_the_worst_thing_you_can_do_i/,12,2,1729102302.0

Another darkside of Gambling addiction,"Another insidious aspect of gambling addiction is how it warps your sense of reality, especially when it comes to losses. One of the worst parts is the way you forget the massive losses after a small win. You could be down $20,000, desperately chasing that money, and then—boom—you win $1,000. In that moment, it feels like a victory. You feel this rush of excitement, like you’ve somehow come out on top. But in reality, that $1,000 is just a tiny fraction of what you’ve lost. It’s a drop in the ocean, and yet, your mind tricks you into thinking you’re ahead. The addiction makes you cling to that small win, convincing yourself that you’re “making progress” or that you’re just one win away from a big turnaround, when really, you’re still sinking deeper into the hole.

And this is the proof that it’s not even about the money anymore—it’s all about the dopamine rush. That small win gives you a high, and it makes you feel good temporarily, but it’s completely detached from the bigger picture. Gambling addiction isn’t about logical thinking or financial recovery; it’s about chasing that quick hit of dopamine, no matter the cost. The addiction rewires your brain so that even a small, fleeting win feels like a massive victory, distracting you from the overwhelming reality of how much you’ve lost. It’s the dopamine driving every decision, not reason or common sense.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g55bjb/another_darkside_of_gambling_addiction/,30,6,1729100547.0
I Dreamed About Slots Last Night,"It’s day 10 clean from gambling, and last night, I had a dream. I dreamt that I went with my father, to play slots. In the dream, on the second .50 cent spin, I hit for 8K. It was a warm, cozy dream, and I woke up feeling relaxed and happy.

And then I totally woke up. Reality hit me in the face.

The reality is, I’ve dumped almost the entirety of my savings into slot machines over the last few months.   It took a come long time and hard work to make that money. I have sworn off the casino multiple times, only to go back and dump thousands into the machines and table games.  Despite this, only a short time after my last loss, I start drooling and fantasizing about gambling again, when all it would cause is sure pain and destruction because once I start, I cannot stop. 

I don’t get to decide when I get off of the gambling ride once I start. I lose the power of choice and only stop when I have caused massive damage. Even then, once I stop, it is only a matter of time until I gamble again if left to my own devices. My brain will trick me into gambling again. At certain times, The consequences of the last time I got spanked don’t come into my brain as clearly as it would a normal persons brain. My brain is broken when it comes to gambling. This is why I cannot rely on my own willpower alone to stop. I need to actively engage support groups, focus on helping others, and put blocks in place if I am going to have a chance. My addiction is progressive, consistently getting worse, and it is working in the background to get me back into gambling again. 

I have self excluded for life from the Hard Rock, went and shared in a GA meeting, I have supports now, and this weekend I will be going around South Florida to self exclude from all of them. No stones left unturned, I am going to self exclude from all of the casinos here for life. I have a friend who understands the gravity of the situation coming with me to each place to ensure I don’t gamble.

Just for today, I won’t gamble. Any thoughts you all want to share are welcome. Thanks for reading. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g544sz/i_dreamed_about_slots_last_night/,4,0,1729097578.0

Feel helpless and guilty for not being able to help brother ,"I have been doing research and seeking guidance regarding how to handle my brother’s gambling problem. We have bailed him out 4 times in the past but he keeps surpassing the previous loss amount. We realise we could be enabling him unintentionally. Hence, we will not bail him out today.

We see him struggling. He doesn’t listen to us. I can imagine what he feels. He said he wants to stop. But he hasn’t been successful in quitting. He is alone, lost friends, lost relationships, lost credibility, almost lost his job. He is in deep shit, and there is nothing we are able to do.

How do we deal with the guilt and helplessness. We all love him, and it reflects in our actions so far. But we have ended up in a deeper mess. Can’t see him suffer anymore.

Would anyone be willing to use a fintech app built from the ground up to assist problem gamblers?,"Hey everyone. I’ve been a gambling addict for about 2 years now. 

With all the banking apps that’ve been popping up left and right (Revolut, Chime, etc.) I’ve been workshopping the idea of a banking app built specifically to help protect gamblers. I’ve faced personal frustration with the freedom offered by banks (quite frankly it should never to excusable to let a customer blow through $3000 in a single night on a gambling site) and limited solutions. A lot of gambling site blockers like Gamban aren’t an option and easy to bypass, so why not stop the deposit directly at the source?

I’ve seen some people say that banks like Chase offer the opportunity to block gambling transactions, but such options are hardly all-inclusive of every site with outdated blacklists and making it laughably easy to disable.

With the growing legality and adoption of sweepstakes gambling as a business model, along with how lucrative the industry has been in states where it’s fully legal, the amount of problem gamblers will rise with 100% certainty. The customer base and underserved need is there, but nobody has seen the potential of such an idea.

To everyone who’s struggling with problem gambling, would you be willing to use such a service? What features would you like to see  that would absolutely prevent you from gambling? How much would you be willing to pay for such a service?

Day 5 ~ Regret is easy.,"It’s easy to have regret. 

But the truth is. In that moment you didn’t do what it takes to have a better life. You chose the easy way. 

Now looking back, you are still not doing what you needed to do back then. It’s easier to have regret and feel victim of your life decisions and circumstances. 

If you really have regret and want to make up for it, it’s time to take action. 

Do what you needed to do years ago.

It’s the only way to improve yourself.

Stop having regret, look back at it as a life lesson; you needed to get here, to eventually get to a better place. 

The better place is where you are going right now, with only good decisions.

You know by now which way you don’t want to go, so do the opposite. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g4uzgz/day_5_regret_is_easy/,7,2,1729069428.0

Approaching day 4.,"Last night at about 0100, I called 1-800-GAMBLER. I vented to her, and she provided me a counselors number. I made it to the gym today and it felt good. I still have this mentally of making it all back. The ""What ifs.""  What if I played that slot or stuck to plinko, I would of hit big or broke even. What if I spun the slot, instead of buying the bonuses. And so on...

This feeling has to subside. I know the odds of hitting that jackpot, or breaking even is against me. Yet, my mind is tricking me with false hope. I would like to thank everyone who has commented and upvoted. Yall gave me strength, hope, and will power to fight against this gruesome addiction.

Day 2,"I selled all the stocks and waiting for the money to be available for withdrawal. I will keep everything in saving accounts with small interest as I did so far. No more charts going up and down creating feelings of wins and losses. Self-exluded from the website that I gambled recently. Will wait for a couple of weeks for the gambling poison to abandon my mind and soul and start chasing clients. Winter is a good season for work, I will try to find a second job that needs body activity and human interaction so that I will reduce my screen time.

Usually I need 6 months for the gambling effects to go completely. I hope this time will be sooner as the session lasted only 9 days. Losing 4.5K in 9 days is definitely bad but on the other side it's better than losing the same amount in 30 or 60 or 90 days, because you gain more time of real life and less time with the shitty activity and mind status called gambling.

I will try to analyze for good what drove me back to gambling after 645 clean days and take all the measures that this will not happen again.

Today i woke up after 9 hours of good sleep and remembered how I woke up yesterday in the middle of anxiety, checking the gambling account balance and realizing how much I lost, and putting some more money to chase losses and gamble at 05:30 in the morning, tired and with black cycles starting appear under my eyes.

I will win this shit for good this time. It may be Day 2 but for me it's a basket game and currently I am ahead 647 - 9

647 Days clean vs 9 days sick

I am going for 1000 - 9 and then for 2000 - 9

23 yrs 8k debt ,"I don't know why I am writing this I think that I want to share my story.

I self excluded for lifetime from every online casino that I have access to today. 

The last 5 days started like this. 

I was already 2k in debt. 

I had about 1K saved, started gambling then I started to win. 


Wins turned to losses so I took a loan of 3k 

Started doing the same 

Then a loan of 2.8k 


Yesterday I was up a total of 8.2k 

Could have easily repay back everything even my original debt. 

Today I lost 4.5k... then I self excluded. 

I have no job currently, only working online for some people here and there. 

It's not so bad, I know that I can recover maybe in 3 months from all of this. 


I just can't understand why I couldn't stop today . 

Could've stopped at 8.2k 
7.5k 7k and so on.. 


I feel very bad for myself and I can't sleep and my anxiety is through the roof honestly. 

I've made up a budget, time to quit smoking as well, no money can be spent now on silly addictions so maybe a good thing came from all of this haha.


I just feel really bad about how things turned out

I overcame my addiction. ,"I was unaware, i was in denial, i was oblivious to the risks, i was lost.

My awareness toward my addiction is at its peak (so far), i know to which extend it has impacted me and my surroundings, i know what’s at stake if i ever go down that path. Still lost in general, but not addiction wise. 

Still experiencing urges still having strong barriers in place, still commited not to allow myself to forget the pain, still reporting urges to myself at the end of each month. 
Actually still re-assessing every single aspect of my recovery. 
the only constant is : gambling free is the life i’ve chosen, gambling-free is the life i’ll work for. I won’t live but gambling free.

I overcame my addiction through awareness.

The price it takes (not remotely financialy) to grow your awareness is tremendous, every rock bottom does, every misery in your life does, every pressure in the chest does every night of worry does, this is the common road for a compulsive gambler until the breakup point where it is no longer beareable.

Introducing Myself,"Hello Everyone,
I would like to introduce myself to this group of which I joined a couple of months ago because I thought it would help me with my addiction. I am 24(F) living in the US. My addiction didn’t start right away. When I turned 21, Me and a friend of mine went to the casino for the first time to gamble for fun. I lost all the money I came with, which was only $60. It’s so funny looking back because I told myself I would never gamble because I knew the type of person I am and I seen this addiction ruin my entire childhood. However, I was right. I wasn’t upset about the loss nor did I want to chase it. Until, my mom had asked me to go with her one day. We played Spanish 21. My very first time on the tables. It was exciting, but I didn’t know how to play but my mom helped me. It didn’t get interesting until I hit the side bet for almost $3,000! Crazy thing is, I didn’t play the side bet. I know, crazy right! But at that moment, I knew I wanted more. Fast forward a couple of months, I am in the casino every single friday, using up all of my money and going home empty handed. It would get to a point where I would go alone and be there all day. The most I’ve ever won was $700 on slots, but the fact that I would’ve won $3,000 if I had played the side bet just kept sticking with me. I ended up hitting the side bets 3 more times and still I didn’t play it. Why? I dont know. But eventually, I kept chasing and chasing to the point where I had no money for anything. Birthdays, Christmas, any holidays. I was always broke but I couldn’t stop. Eventually, I stopped going and moved on to gambling online. It got extremely worse! I just couldn’t stop, I would try and talk to people close to me about it but they were gamblers too so it was more of encouragement than advice happening. Fast forward to now, I am 24 and have been gambling for 3 years nonstop. I had finally hit the biggest jackpot ever, thinking I can finally stop and made all of my money back. I am now about $19,000 in debt. I have taken out 2 loans since then. I am currently living paycheck to paycheck trying to keep up with my bills and trying to pay off all of my debts that incurred due to me gambling. My credit is 👎🏼, I’ve lied to those around me and to myself. I am currently doing alot better than I was. I am slowly stopping and paying off my debts. I know it will get easier and I know I can do it and for those who stopped to read this, you got this too! You are not alone and we got this! I know one day we will sit back and laugh about the dumb decisions we made along the way. I am open to any advice and if anyone needs my advice or support I am here for them also.

Gambling Addiction is not what you think it is ,"People see gambling addiction the wrong way because they treat it like it’s just a “bad habit” or poor decision-making. Gambling addiction isn’t about money—it’s about control. It’s about how your brain gets rewired to chase highs, to feel alive when everything else feels dull or unmanageable. People think it’s about throwing cash away, but they don’t see the psychological chains that keep you coming back, even when you know it’s ruining your life.

I was one of those people who used to say, “What losers gambling addicts are.” I thought it was just weakness—until I got stuck in it myself. The thing is, gambling is the fix. Once you taste that fix, you get hooked. It’s not about greed or bad decisions; it’s about the rush, the dopamine hit, that false promise that the next win will make everything right. Even when you’re losing, it convinces you that just one more spin, one more bet, will bring everything back.

What people don’t understand is that quitting isn’t just about stopping. Quitting gambling means facing the emptiness and rebuilding your life without that rush. It means finding a way to deal with the boredom, the stress, the pain without relying on that next high. The addiction isn’t about the money—it’s about the way gambling takes over your mind, convinces you that your worth and happiness are tied to chance.

I used to think gamblers were just irresponsible, but now I know it’s deeper, darker, and harder to escape than most can imagine. Gambling addiction is not just a financial pit—it’s an emotional prison that’s nearly impossible to break free from unless you recognize the real damage it’s doing. Until people understand that, they’ll keep seeing it as just another vice, instead of the life-consuming trap it truly is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g4k193/gambling_addiction_is_not_what_you_think_it_is/,106,18,1729030630.0

You’re Not Gambling for Money,"At first, it feels like you’re just chasing losses, trying to undo the damage. But as the addiction sinks in, it stops being about recovering money and becomes about chasing the high—the dopamine rush. That’s why, even when we know deep down we can’t win back what we’ve lost, we keep going, keep gambling, trading, or betting. Our brains have been rewired, the balance is off, and we’re hooked on the chemical hit of excitement.

But here’s the thing: the sooner you realize it’s not about the money but about the dopamine, the easier it will be to quit. And to quit for good, you need total abstinence—no half measures. The brain needs time to heal, to reset itself. Those dopamine receptors, fried from overuse, need to adjust to a life without constant stimulation.

To achieve full abstinence, though, you need to take some tough but necessary steps. It’s not enough to just stop gambling or trading; you have to starve the addiction so it can’t find any way to get another fix. That means handing over control of your finances to someone you trust, ensuring you don’t have access to money for impulsive decisions. You also need to self-exclude from casinos, betting platforms, and trading apps—anywhere that temptation exists. Starving the addiction means cutting off every possible path that could lead you back to that high.

You can’t gamble if you don’t have money to gamble with, and you can’t feed the addiction if there’s no way to access the temptation. These steps aren’t easy, but they’re essential if you’re serious about getting your life back. It’s about building barriers so strong that the addiction can’t break through, and in time, your brain can begin to heal and return to its natural state.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g4iygi/youre_not_gambling_for_money/,11,5,1729027711.0

$10k savings lost (PH),"Hi all I just wanted to share with you my recent relapse. I was already down $9k before this and I tried gambling again. I only got to as high as $120 in profit before I spiraled and lost $1k. Before this I was almost a month clean, no urges and no temptations. I really thought I could control it this time around but I just keep on spiraling. I need to stop convincing myself that I won’t spiral because 1000% of the time I just do. 

My family depends on me as I’m the only one with a stable income and I still live with my mother and siblings. 

The good thing here is these are just purely my  savings and I don’t owe anything to anyone. I don’t borrow money from my credit card and ask loans from people. I took a second full-time job to be able to “chase my losses” by working and it will take me about 8 months to recover my losses. I just really hope I don’t spiral this time around. 

Any tips to self-exclude here in the Philippines would be greatly appreciated. Especially on PlayTime PH as I can never get myself to be banned here. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g4a0d8/10k_savings_lost_ph/,2,4,1729005071.0

Looking for other adults late new gamblers to put my story in some more perspective ..,"This is something i have in mind while reading posts here.

It seems a common thing for people to be dealing with Gambling for years and years, mostly starting young.

Personally I fell into it at age 33, and blew 30k by my 34. Basically a year period with 3 months  separated were i won and lost all that money.

As much as it makes me feel ""safe"" because i don't carry the weight of years of gambling as it seem harder to get rid of, I feel ""unsafe"" and shameful because I have actually blown a lot of money in ""just"" one year, while being already adult and responsible for myself financially...

I'd like to know if there are people like me, and if someone (like me) have managed to recover durably from that mistake. 

Since my last big rant in august i have had a couple relaspes that have also hurt me but mostly in the mind an guts than in my wallet. I feel relatively confident I can beat this shit to dust and out of my mind, but some extra ""contexte"" around my situation and ground of comparison could help me dealing with it.

Day 1 after a crazy roller coaster that lasted 9 days,"Finally, putting money on stocks proved a wrong move again for 2nd time in the last years. My last relapse back in 2022 happened after I put some money on stocks and turned into a crazy 2-month roller coaster with 3.5K losses. This time, I put 9K on stocks couple of weeks ago and it looks like this again awaked the monster. Last 9 days I gambled like maniac, mostly on roulette but on other games too and lost 4.5K in total. I will wait for the markets to open today, will close all my positions, will get the bonus in the afternoon on the gambling website that I played, withdraw it and self exlude for lifetime. Will be back to work, as not is this the only way, but this is the only way to feel happy and a normal human being. Last 3 years were good for me financially, as I saw my net value grow by a 6 figures amount and I live in a relatively poor country.

My total recent gambling losses are 3K in 2021, 3.5K in 2022 and 4.5K now which makes a total of 11K for 3.5 years or 3.28K per year, which is nothing compared with what I lost in the very bad years (my worst year was >100K losses)

Back to work, I will try to never gamble again a single penny for the next 2 years. Of course lifetime is even better, but let's stick to the 2 years for now and will see then if I can go further to 3, 4 or more years. I stayed clean for 645 days and I am sure I can do it again. This way of living I feel that it doesn't fit to me anymore. Sticking your nose in front of a screen, watching a figure going up and down. I really do not find anything interesting to that anymore and I don't want to do it again. In 9 days I spent more than 100 hours on an stupid activity with negative hourly rate. I could spend it simply on work and get paid for this 100 hours with a good rate. So instead of giving these 4.5K to these thieves, I could help a client with a project and get 2, 3, 4K for my effort and time. This is what I am used to doing.

Everything that comes together with gambling is disgusting. The anxiety, the abandonment of the real life, the shady transactions to casinos that polluts your bank accounts, the unproductivity, the isolation, etc

I always say to fellow posters on this sub that relapsing after staying X days clean is always better than having gambled all the X days plus the day X+1. This is my consolation too. I am sure that if I had gambled all the previous 645 days I would now be homeless and peniless for sure

So Day 1 for me today, targetting to break my record of 645 days clean. ODAAT",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g44ssb/day_1_after_a_crazy_roller_coaster_that_lasted_9/,5,3,1728989327.0
710 days gratefully without a bet,"Today:  
·       I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

·       I am grateful to see the deep-seated self-hatred feelings and thoughts that are still within me.

·       I am grateful to see the resentful feelings and thoughts inside towards perceived self-imperfections and strong inner resistance to full unconditional acceptance of how I am and the way things are inside and outside.

·       I am grateful to see the inner pain and suffering that’s caused from this self-hatred.

·       I am grateful to see how this self-hatred comes from belief in stories my mind keeps telling me about what should and shouldn’t be, stories that were first told to me long ago that I believed then and cling to now as truth about the way things are.

·       I am grateful to admit that these stories are just what they are. Stories. Fictions. They’re not truth, they’re not reality.     

·       I am grateful for this morning’s meditation and the acts of lovingkindness I am giving to myself. I know that the more I genuinely give and express unconditional love towards myself the way I do with my son, and the more clearly I see what’s real and what’s bullshit and made-up, the healthier I will feel and be inside.  

·       I am grateful for these reminders that I am not body, sensations, thoughts, or feelings. I am awareness that sees, feels and experiences these things inside.

Been sleeping for most part of these last 4 days and binge-watching every movie/tv show that I can, that's been distracting my mind.

But the hard part is that I started a new job at the same time I was still gambling, I was so happy when I got it... I've been working for 4 months now, and at least in the beginning I was trying so hard to do a good job, was so hopeful of the future and willing to do it, but then I started gambling simultaneously as I worked (I work from home), so, I must assume that most of these 4 months that I've worked I wasn't even looking at my job screen, just hitting backspace to play some slot online, and now, I feel so depressed and lazy to work, if I'm not gambling then most of these days I'll just been sleep on my chair or going to bed after turning my computer on, there's not much to do at job so probably no one is noticing it NOW, but they will. I can't lose that job because I have debts to pay, but I lost the will to do good at it, because of this sick shit I've been doing to my own brain.

28 years old and probably around 150k lifetime losses (mostly stock options as well as sports betting). Went on a binge today on online blackjack and lost 5k. Just so sick of this stupidity. Self banned and excluded right after. 

Still have some savings but not nearly as much as I could’ve had + all the time and stress I’ve spent the last decade on gambling. It’s robbed me of so much more than money, and I am stopping now as I recognize I am still relatively young and hope to change the track of my life.

He now spends 2-300/ day on online craps and poker games and this has increasingly gotten worse. For context I am a bartender so I come home with cash if I don’t give him money to play it is a complete narcissistic rebuttal that I don’t support him etc. it has gotten to the point where he doesn’t pay any bills with his normal income only if he wins off of poker. He is in complete denial he has a problem and it is a very scary argument when brought up.

I keep telling myself the day I lose I will stop gambling but for some reason I still go back. Maybe cause I work night shifts at home and have nothing to do and get my high off so I resort to gambling. I took out a loan to pay off all my credit card debt...and guess what all that debt came back cause I took out again from my credit cards after it was all paid off from my loan now I owe an excess amount of $10K in loans... absolutely disgusting behaviour. My life's pretty boring I have no car,no gf, live with my parents and just can't find fun in life rn. I make 64K/year but I just feel like I'm wasting my years of my 20s just paying off debt with no investments and $0 savings.

I am in control ,"
Some people think they’re not addicted because someone else has lost more, convincing themselves they’re still in control. But that’s a dangerous lie. Addiction isn’t about how much you’ve lost, it’s about your inability to stop, no matter what happens. If you’re comparing yourself to others to justify your behavior, that’s a massive red flag. The moment you believe you’re in control while gambling, you’ve already lost it. And by the time you realize it, the damage won’t just be financial—it’ll consume your future, your relationships, and your mental health.

709 days gratefully without a bet,"Today:  
·       I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

·       I am grateful for this morning’s meditation and resetting my day after a tumultuous early morning.

·       I am grateful to keep working on how I handle inner pain and suffering inside. I didn’t do a great job after waking up very early this morning after a wild couple hours of dreaming with a headache and very weird feelings inside, and resorted to old pain aversion behaviors like midnight eating and playing video games for hours.

·       I am grateful that I gave myself some unconditional lovingkindness this morning. I’m not perfect, and last night does not give me rationale to keep believing that inner voice inside that is just negative about me all the time, even if it doesn’t want me to say that.

·       I am grateful to recognize that what’s happening today is the result of the way things are, cause and effect from so many different elements of life and nature. It really doesn’t have to do with the concept of me that’s been made up inside over the years.

·       I am grateful that the teachers in my life keep reminding me about keeping perspective and remembering that all of it keeps changing and I don’t own any of it.

·       I am grateful to admit that I keep giving in to the inner voice and urge to alleviate the pain inside instead of being patient, enduring, and accepting of the way things are.

Recovery and ADHD,"I recently realized that I had a gambling addiction and stopped cold turkey, which has been very difficult considering it was an app on my phone, but here we are. I never thought it was a problem until I would see how much I would go through in a day, let alone a month, and after a session, I would feel zoned out and exhausted (after the adrenaline would wear off) and my jaw would hurt from clenching it so much. I would even tell myself that I could get everything back and this was similar to a harmless hobby that someone has and I was doing it in small increments, but that definitely added up over time. The shame from losing would make me physically sick.

It’s hard finding things to do, and I even have a baby (15 months old)! I think it was a great way to zone out and definitely intensified after becoming a parent and having your time and activities more restricted. Instead of having free time to do whatever/whenever, I’m on a time table and it was a way to fill my time. My husband works night shifts and I work during the day, so I have limited adult interaction and it’s hard to unwind after a long day and take care of a little one. I’ve been focusing on cleaning and organizing, which gives me the same satisfaction or feeling of accomplishment, so that’s nice, but you can only do that for so long and I don’t want to lose interest in it (as I’ve lost interest in other hobbies and I’m not about to invest in something else at the moment). I’m also on a GLP-1 drug and have lost weight, so I’m not eating or snacking as much as I used to, so I think that also could have led to my increased gaming use. 

I have ADHD and take Concerta and Wellbutrin, and I want to make sure that these aren’t adding to the physical/mental withdrawals so I think I’m going to discuss this with my doctor, as I haven’t been upfront about what’s really going on in my life. It’s hard/physically uncomfortable to sit still without doing something even mentally, so this has been a struggle. It’s been nice reading others posts on here so I will say that I’m optimistic and willing to try/learn anything to feel better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g35rdr/recovery_and_adhd/,3,2,1728871882.0

"My Story, you might wanna read it…","I remember 2018 like it was yesterday. That year was a turning point, though I had no idea how deep it would go. It all started innocently enough—just a few friends bragging about their mutual fund returns, talking like they had cracked the secret to easy money. I knew nothing about the stock market at the time, but their excitement got to me. I figured, why not give it a shot? So, without much thought, I took $10k and invested it in the same mutual funds they were hyping up.

Then, almost immediately, the market tanked. Within days, I was down $1k, and I felt like I’d been punched in the gut. It was my first real taste of loss. I hated it, but I didn’t sell. I didn’t know what else to do, so I held on, hoping things would bounce back. A month later, I was back to breakeven, and that’s when my brain, this twisted, addiction-prone brain, started whispering to me: “You can do more. Take more risks. You’ve got this.”

That’s when I decided to ditch the mutual funds and start buying individual stocks. I didn’t know what I was doing, but I didn’t care. I wanted bigger returns, and I was willing to gamble for them. I heard about this stock—a supposed “mega return” opportunity. I’m not going to name it, but it was from a certain country, and I bought in at the absolute worst time. I bought at the top. Of course, I immediately lost $3.5k. That one hurt, but instead of stepping back and reassessing, I doubled down. I convinced myself I could win it back.

Then, I found a company I became obsessed with. I dove in deep. I spent hours on forums, researching, reading every scrap of information I could find. I even built a website about it, like I was some kind of expert. I was so convinced this was my ticket. I put $20k into it, and for once, it paid off. The stock doubled, and suddenly, I was up big. I felt invincible. I thought I had finally figured it out, that I had cracked the market.

But then 2020 hit, and the pandemic crashed everything. My $20k profit vanished overnight, turning into a $5k loss. I was devastated. The only thing that saved me from total ruin was a short position I had in Tesla. I managed to make $7k from that, but it wasn’t enough. Instead of taking that win and walking away, I got greedy again. I held on, convinced the market would keep dropping. The Fed started printing money, and the market—especially Tesla—started skyrocketing. Before I knew it, my short position was killing me, and I lost $20k on Tesla alone. By the end of 2020, I was down $25k in total.

I could feel myself spiraling. Every morning, I woke up with this gnawing feeling in my stomach, like I was sinking deeper and deeper into a hole I couldn’t climb out of. The losses kept mounting, and the depression was unbearable. By 2021, I was in such a dark place that I finally broke down and told my parents everything. I confessed about the losses, the constant anxiety, and the suicidal thoughts creeping in. I was ashamed, but I didn’t know what else to do.

My parents were more supportive than I ever deserved. They told me they thought I had a gambling addiction, that the way I was acting wasn’t normal. They saw it clearly, even though I couldn’t. Of course, I didn’t believe them. I was still convinced I could fix everything if I just made one more big win. But I promised them I would stop. I swore I was done. They even gave me money, not to invest, but just to help me get back on my feet. They wanted to ease my stress, so they bought me a car, a $20k gesture of love and support to lift my spirits. And I promised, again, that I would stop.

But like the idiot I was, I went right back into the market. The car was barely in the driveway before I found myself glued to the stock charts again, chasing losses, trying to outsmart a system that had already swallowed me whole.

By the end of 2021, I was down $41k. I was a wreck. My addiction was running my life, and I couldn’t see a way out. I kept betting against the market, thinking the crash I had been predicting for months was just around the corner. But the market just kept climbing, mocking me with every new high.

Then, in 2022, the bear market finally came, and for a moment, I saw a glimmer of hope. My short positions started paying off. I clawed my way back from -41k to -7k. For every 1% drop in the indices, I made $2k. It felt like I was finally getting my revenge on the market. But instead of taking my profits and walking away, I kept pushing, thinking I could squeeze out just a little more.

Fast forward to 2024, and here I am, standing in the wreckage of my decisions. My losses are somewhere between $65k and $80k. I don’t even know the exact number because I’m too terrified to check. Leverage and index trading killed me. Every time I thought I was on the verge of winning, it pulled me deeper. I’m 30 years old with only $33k to my name. I’ve ruined my financial future. I let my wife down, I let my parents down, and most of all, I let myself down. My addiction has cost me everything.

In 2024, I started getting serious health issues. The stress had been piling up for years, and my body finally gave out. I started experiencing dizziness, and one day, I thought I was going to have a stroke. My head felt like it was going to explode. I was terrified. My wife came to me, supported me, and stayed by my side through it all. That was the moment I realized how far gone I was, how much I had let this addiction take over my life. The health scare was a wake-up call, a sign that I couldn’t keep going like this—not just for my finances, but for my life.

That was when I made the hardest decision I’ve ever made. I knew I couldn’t trust myself anymore, so I handed over all my finances to my wife. Every last cent I had, I transferred to her account. Now, if I don’t have access to the money, I can’t gamble it away in the stock market. It was humbling, and even embarrassing, to admit that I couldn’t control myself, but I had to do it. I needed that barrier. Without money, I can’t gamble. Without access, I can’t destroy what little I have left.

I quit in 2024, finally, after realizing I’d fucked my life up enough. If I kept going, there wouldn’t be anything left to salvage. I can’t keep gambling away my future. I refuse to keep letting this addiction ruin my life. This is my story, my mess. If you’re reading this, I hope you learn something from it, because I learned the hard way—there’s no winning in this game. Not in the long run.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g2z5vv/my_story_you_might_wanna_read_it/,44,20,1728851700.0
Thank you/Question,"Had some really nice and thoughtful comments/tips on my last post.

I feel like it's not losing US Currency that makes me feel so bad, it's the fact that I was able to ""rob"" the sportsbooks by making 33k and because of that, it made me feel I could do this for a living. I had been told plenty of times to be careful and even when I had lost half of it was ready to call it quits, but still didn't. It's just embarrassing and I feel like crap. Another hard part is knowing how much time I wasted doing this. Countless late nights sweating bets and pacing around the room, telling myself never again and the next night did it, missing out on social events due to watching sports and gambling. Knowing I have to work a bunch of months to get it back is deflating, but I know money is not everything and need a better perspective.

Does anyone have any tips to forget about gambling losses or things to do besides gambling or even extra ways to make money?

So far I've basically deleted most social media or blocked accounts/words that mention gambling. I've also thought about my losses are buying something that I never got like a car or like a vacation. I was wondering if this is a good coping mechanism because it's all I can think of right now to make me feel somewhat better. Luckily I've officially banned myself on all sportsbooks and submitted the official Kansas Self Exclusion form.

708 days gratefully without a bet,"Today:

  
·       I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

·       I am grateful for the enduring patience I am cultivating inside to handle whatever emotions and lashing out that my soon-to-be teenage son is doing as a result of setting screen time limits across his devices.

·       I am grateful to admit that while I know we should have done this years ago, I’m glad we decided to do it now early in puberty.

·       I am grateful to accept that all I can do is handle what’s happening in front of me, and I can’t / don’t have the right to judge what other families do with their kids. That’s for them to handle, not for me.

·       I am grateful to my wife for supporting this approach and for withstanding his verbal attacks this morning while I was out volunteering at the animal shelter.

·       I am grateful that sometimes short-term pain leads to long-term peace and serenity. It reminds me of abstinence and recovery from addiction, including necessary early steps to put barriers in place to make sure I couldn’t act on inner urges to engage in self-destructive behavior.

·       I am grateful that I am thinking and acting out of a place of greater mental clarity and wisdom instead of disturbed emotional distress. This is evidence to me of progress made as a result of recovery.

·       I am grateful to continue living life one day at a time, through the highs and lows, and accepting it for what it is rather than what my ego wants it to be.

Depression,"How many of you males were and are depressed when you started gambling. Stressed about bills money and how you were gonna keep ur family afloat. Me myself I pay for two house holds pretty much have a good job but probably over financed especially now with gambling involved debt is pulling me down heavy, making life pretty hard to cope most days. I feel shut off from the world and my family and children which is what’s killing me the most I’m not even remotely happy. my gambling became very heavy after I entered 2 more children into my life 3 years ago I love them but they weren’t children I wanted at the start but I took fault and excepted it but deep down it caused me stress and anxiety doubt as a man if I could honestly handle it as I have two other kids with a different women which I aswell take care of sounds selfish in hindsight but I do love all these kids of course I created them they didn’t ask to be here . 
Long story short it was basically work and take care of kids when I got home from work and on days off I’d have my other kids. Fairly out going prior did fun things golfed a lot enjoyed life a little more per say. Now here comes online gambling to burn my world in the end at the beginning it was fun I was depositing a 50 there and there and like 2k all the way up to 6k up a few times fast forward 8 months later we’re spending 2k a night sometimes a paycheck because this is what I started using to occupy myself with fun while being pretty much a work slave and a stay at home dad I’m just putting out my story to see if u guys think depression and boredom lead me to gambling or if gambling lead me to depression sorry for the story I’m 6 days clean as I relapsed 2 time in the 3 months I’ve been trying to stop anyways cheers guys and gals I hope we make it through this. Currently drowning in gambling debt but looking for some answers do I sound like I’m making excuses or does this sound real ? I just wanna be saved from myself !

I told my parents about it, and they were that I quit too. They promised to support me in any way possible. Fast forward to yesterday. I lost it all and more. I’ve lost my money I’d worked hard on last year.

I had a chance. I'd never have had this before. And the probability of it is so tiny, I will never will have it again.

It was the year of my salary. I don't care about the money, to be honest. I'm sad about my parents who were having faith in me, they’ll be disappointed with me. They told me they believed I won’t throw this money away, that I have the power to handle this craving.

Not gonna lie, when I saw the money the first thing that came to my mind was : now I can play high stake poker. But instantly one friend told that he needed the money.

I quickly turned away, feeling disgust. 

I looked back and felt sad seeing her lose multiple times, I hope she's wont get in the same situation I am in.

I got envious, I remember the thrill of hitting it big. I had a 10000x one time. Then I remembered, that 10000x was way less than I lost. 

Now I'm back to being mad at myself. I shouldnt have started. I cant afford to treat myself and the ones I care for. I'm stuck at celebrating this measly 24days of being gambling free. I am celebrating not because I won but because I didnt lose today.

Depressed after counting how much money I have remaining,"I quit gambling about 2.5 months ago, and only had 300 euro left in my bank account. This is awful because I used to have close to 30 grand saved, and over the years it's all gone gambling. Anyway, when I quit gambling back in July I think, I withdrew the remainder of my cash (300) and put it into piggy bank. It's the kind you have to cut open with a can opener, so I wouldn't just be able to take the money if I got the urge (I didn't buy a can opener)

Anyway, I don't trust myself with digital funds, so whenever I get paid from work I withdraw it ifrom the ATM and out it into my piggy bank. I relapsed once because my pay came at midnight, so I had like 8 hours before I could get access to an ATM to withdraw.......with funds in my bank account, I ended up depositing on a stupid online casino and ended up losing 350 euro by morning. But since then, I haven't gambled and have managed to save whatever's left over after bills. 

However, today I got curious and bought a can opener to check how much money I had saved. Only 2400. Not bad compared to the measly 300 I had left when I first quit, but still, it's been over 2 months and that's all I have. I calculated that I should have another 2.5k saved by christmas, so by the end of the year I'll only have 5,000 euro in savings. I'm in my mid-late 20s, that's so bad.

Telling others about the gambling,"Im just curious what was the breaking point, when you told parents, friends or partners about your gambling problem?
How did the talk go, did they understand that this was a nasty addiction and offered help or did they distance from you?

I mostly talk about it with a friend, who has the same problem, but seems to be more of a trigger than a help, because he doesnt intend to quit. 

I told my gf about it, when i hit the rock bottom, was a tough talk, but she helped me, payed of some loans, but our relationship was never the same after that. I was clean for a few months after that, but fell into a pit yet again. Making up excuses, why i am constantly without money. I know i should tell her that i relapsed, but its hard, knowing that this would be the end most likely.

I told one of my parents a few days ago, it was one of the toughest conversations in my life, but i felt better after that, also offered some financial help.

It gave me some hope and motivation to tell my other parent aswell. Seems like this is finally the time to get out of this life destroying addiction. I feel the obligation to tell it to gf too, to finally account for my mistakes and wrong doings, even if this means that we will go seperate ways..

Sorry for the long post and have a nice day :)

Thoughts,"Tomorrow can be the best day of your life.
  
  For a majority of my life I was one of the lucky ones. I could gamble in a recreational and occasional way, staying within my limit, stepping away with no difficulty and living a normal life. What I didn't know is how quickly gambling can become destructive .
 With the right life circumstances, behavioral changes and mental struggles this addiction grabbed ahold of me and i didn't even realize it. It took up my time, changed my personality, sucked away my money and very nearly ruined everything I hold most dear.
  I went from gambling small amounts once every few months with my friends to losing 10-20 times that nightly and by myself. I hid my gambling, I craved my gambling and despised it constantly. It became a horrible cycle of depression, shame and guilt that I didn't know how to escape. But I did
  I told someone, it was so hard to do, but i did it. I talked about it, and I wanted to change. These things changed me. By telling someone I trusted, who cared about me, I was able to begin my recovery. But also, I wanted to change. I wanted to be better, and I wasn't afraid of the work it would take.
   It takes work, you have to commit to it, you have to want this part of your life changed. It's not about just saying I'm going to quit (I tried that). It's about putting in the work. Change  how you access money, trust in someone to manage your finances, even in the short term. Start going to GA, your not alone, hear about other journeys with this addiction. Talk to an addiction therapist, figure out those triggers and learn to block them. Begin mindful mediation, you matter, this moment matters, your life matters. Just know that gambling doesn't have to control you if you don't want it to.
  Give up the control that gambling has over you. Want the change, put in the work and tomorrow can be the best day of your life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g2fkok/thoughts/,3,1,1728785551.0

yung last cash ko kagabi pumaldo 3500 inout ko na pero di pako antok eh, ang ending inilaban ko sa ibang site gang sa umabot ng 3am na gising padin ako at talo ng 6k maghapon + yung 3500 na panalo naibalik pa sa casino, TANGA KO DIBA.

ngayong umaga bago pumasok, atupag ko yung mga daily sahod/rebates sa mga site na nilaruan ko baka pumaldo, gang sa yung 35 naging 700 lumipat ako ibang game, bet 100 ako ng x4 dun sa bonus isang bagsak 6800, ang laki na nun diba? pasok na sa satisfied na panalo ko, edi ako since talo kahapon ng 6k, at umabot na pera konsa site nanyung ng 7200 inout ko na, sabi ko pa pang bawi ko sa talo ko kahapon, tamang tama kako at d na muna akoag susugal, ang ending yung site na nalaruan ko sarado na pala, kumabag hindi na sya paying site, scam na, nasa isip ko na yun eh, kasi umabot na ng 30mins wala pa si cash out, so nag pm nako sa mga csr, nag pm nadin ako sa upline ko, tas ayun si upline na ang nah confirm ng hinala ko, close na yung site, di ako inform kasi wala ako dun sa gc nya ( ni leave ako ni partner sa mga online sugal na gc) so ayun, bye bye 6k na talo kahapon, bye bye 7200 pa na panalo na na scam pa.

Is Gamblers Anonymous Basically the Same Thing as Alcoholics Anonymous?,"Hi all, I am recovering alcoholic (5 years without a drink) who has attended hundreds and hundreds of AA meetings, very familiar with the program. I will admit it has been 4 years since I have attended an AA meeting, because I thought my addictive personality was firmly under control.

Unfortunately - this year I have gotten myself in trouble with gambling, and I have accepted that I am an untreated gambling addict, in addition to my 'recovered' alcoholic status.

I 100% understand that my gambling addiction is an urgent situation and must be treated just as seriously as my alcoholism was.

That being said, I am a bit wary of attending Gamblers Anonymous meetings for the primary reasons below:

-Correct me if I am wrong, but I have a belief that Gambler's Anonymous simply replaces the word ""alcohol"" with ""gambling"". If GA philosophy, recovery, tips, tricks, etc. are literally interchangeable with AA, quite frankly I am not sure what benefit GA will have for me.

What can GA teach me that I can't or haven't already learned in AA?

My mindset (again correct me if I'm wrong) is why can't I simply just start going to AA meetings again, if GA is basically 'copy/paste' of the same thing?

-I will admit that one benefit of going to GA is meeting other compulsive gamblers who specifically can share their gambling stories with me. But unfortunately GA has a much much much tinier presence than AA it seems, and short story I think I would be attending GA meetings over webcam. I don't think it would have the same sense of community as AA would.

I could just as easily simply get more involved in the gambling recovery subreddits to hear people's gambler's stories

TLDR: Is Gamblers Anonymous significantly any different than Alcoholic's Anonymous? Unless there is a specific differentiation, why can't I just apply AA principles to my compulsive gambling, and for 'actual' treatment, think I would see a gambling addiction therapist?

Just not sure why I should attend a different 12 step program if it is copy/paste of what AA is.

Again, please correct me if I am wrong in any of this. I do want to admit I have not attended any GA meetings yet, so I could be wrong. Just don't want to waste my time if every 12 step anonymous group is pretty much 1 and the same.

Rock bottom... Again,"From the age of 18 to 28, I struggled with a gambling addiction, which caused a lot of strain in my life. I eventually came clean to my parents when I was around $4,000 in debt, and on top of that, I had misused money my parents gave me to invest in the stock market. Thankfully, after coming clean, I managed to stay away from gambling for the next four years.

But over the last 1-2 years, I’ve fallen back into gambling, and this time, the situation is much worse. I've lost my entire share portfolio—$80,000—which was money my parents gave me to invest. On top of that, I’ve accumulated $10,000 in debt. My wife only knows about the $10,000, but she has no idea about the stock portfolio I’ve lost. Neither do my parents. Tomorrow, I need to tell them both the full truth, and I’m terrified about how they’ll react.

I can’t bear the guilt and shame. I’ve let down everyone I love—my wife and my parents—and I feel like I’ve destroyed their trust. It’s hard to even look at myself, knowing I’ve fallen back into this destructive cycle. I don’t know how to make things right, but I know I need to face this, even though it feels impossible right now.

707 days gratefully without a bet,"Today:

  
·       I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

·       I am grateful for greater mental clarity this morning.

·       I am grateful I get to see my sister this morning for Yom Kippur services, and she gets a chance to be away from her child and just be with adults for a few hours.

·       I am grateful to see the tangled mess inside – fears, insecurities, anxieties – they’re all there regardless of whether I choose to accept their existence or try to deny that they’re there.  

·       I am grateful to see how difficult it is for me to handle pain and suffering inside without resorting to old habitual patterns going back to when I was a baby.

·       I am grateful to see how addicted I am to what my ego has to say about everything and the emotions and feelings I experience inside.

·       I am grateful to understand just how ingrained this addiction is, to the point where I don’t even realize it at a conscious level unless triggered from someone like my therapist or from spiritual teachings.

·       I am grateful to be on this path of liberation from addiction and pray for the perseverance, patience and faith to stay on this path, and for others to have the same strength in their journeys as well. For me, It started with gambling, and I am so grateful to GA for getting me started on this path, but I can see now how much addiction plays a role in my life far beyond gambling.  Acceptance of what it is, and liberation from addiction, is my life’s work, and I am grateful to keep at it, one day at a time.

So it makes today 10/120. If I get there, and I intend to get there, all my debts should be fixed and I shall enjoy these holidays more than the ones from the last 5 years, that has been riddle with debts and not truly enjoying it because of always missing money.

How to Quit Gambling Forever and Regain Your Freedom,"**How to Quit Gambling Forever and Regain Your Freedom:**

1. **Come Clean to People You Trust:** Stop hiding. You need to face the people who care about you and tell them the truth. If no one knows what you’re battling, no one can hold you accountable. This isn’t something you can handle alone—be honest, even if it’s uncomfortable.
2. **Self-Exclude and Close Every Door – No Exceptions:** Lock yourself out from every possible way to gamble—betting sites, casinos, stockbrokers, everything. Don’t fool yourself by leaving a few doors open, thinking you’ll control it. You won’t. Your next “done” might financially kill you. Gambling will bleed you dry if you let it. Block access to everything—every app, every site. Install Gamban on every device. iPhone users: I know you can delete the VPN profile, but there’s a way around it. Give someone you trust the passcode so you can’t remove it. Use Face ID to unlock your phone, but without the passcode, you’re locked in. And if you’re serious? Consider switching to an Android phone where it’s even harder to mess with the restrictions. No half-measures. No fucking doors left open.
3. **Hand Over Control of Your Money – All of It:** If you keep control of your finances, you’re playing with fire. During the addiction phase, your brain will twist itself into finding ways to gamble. You’ll rationalize it. You’ll lie to yourself. You’ll do anything to get that hit. Give your money to someone you trust—spouse, parent, sibling, whoever. If you don’t have access to cash, you can’t gamble. It’s that simple. No money, no bet, no loss. Starve the addiction, and it will eventually die.
4. **Understand the Odds – The Game is Rigged, and You’re Losing:** The house always wins. You’re not special, and you won’t beat the system. Ever. The longer you play, the deeper you’ll sink. Stop lying to yourself, because the end is always the same: broke, miserable, and with nothing left. That’s where you’re headed if you don’t stop right now.
5. **Stop Comparing Yourself to Others – It’s a Trap:** Comparing your life to others will just push you deeper into the addiction. You’ll see someone doing better than you and think gambling will fix it. It won’t. It’ll only make things worse. Treat this like the disease it is. A cancer patient doesn’t worry about someone else’s finances—they focus on surviving. So should you.
6. **Seek Professional Help – Dig Deep to Find the Root Cause:** You’re not gambling for fun anymore. Something deeper is driving this behavior, whether it’s unresolved pain, boredom, or even something like ADHD. Figure out what’s fueling this addiction. Talk to a psychologist and dig deep. The clearer you understand what’s pushing you, the easier it will be to quit for good.
7. **Forgive Yourself, but Don’t Let Yourself Off Easy:** You didn’t plan on becoming a gambling addict, but here you are. Addiction is sneaky—it manipulates you into making destructive choices. Forgive yourself for the past, but don’t sugarcoat it. You made mistakes, and you need to own them. No more excuses. Learn from it, and don’t look back.
8. **Redirect Your Obsession – Make It Work for You, Not Against You:** The same energy and obsession you wasted on gambling can be your greatest weapon—if you turn it toward something productive. Business, fitness, a personal project—whatever it is, pour your energy into that instead of throwing it away on bets. You’ve got the drive to succeed, but you’ve been aiming it in the wrong direction. Change course now, or you’ll crash and burn.
9. **It’s Not About Winning Anymore – It’s the Thrill, the Dopamine:** Once you realize this, quitting becomes easier. Gambling stopped being about winning long ago. It’s about chasing that dopamine hit, the thrill of the risk, the spike of excitement. But no amount of money is worth the stress, panic, sleepless nights, and lost moments. You know what I’m talking about—the constant anxiety, the heart-pounding dread when you realize what you’ve lost. Walk away, because nothing is worth that.
10. **Don’t Die a Gambler – Die with Honor:** I know some of you might feel like giving up. But trust me, you don’t want to die as a gambler. That’s not how you want to go out. You want to die with dignity, as someone who fought and won, not someone who was destroyed by their own addiction. There’s still time to turn this around, but you’ve got to want it. No one’s going to save you but yourself. Fight for your life, and get back to the person you were before this addiction took over. You were strong and beautiful before gambling got its claws into you. It’s time to become that person again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g1wcgy/how_to_quit_gambling_forever_and_regain_your/,19,2,1728724940.0

Day 2,"Trying to keep some kind of track by posting here and always reading your guys topics.

There were times I stopped for some days and it felt so easier at the beginning that it would occur me the thought ""It doesn't hurt doing a $10 deposit to bet low amounts, just to try my luck, I'll just do this one! :D"" and later that turning into $200, $300 and still feeling okay with that, because for me I was kind of compensating for the days I didn't bet.

It will be hard, I only have left $50 at my account waiting for the 15th to get a part of my paycheck and be able to pay my credit cards (to be honest I'll pay one, to use this card to pay another, and to use the other card to pay another, there is NO WAY I can't do that right now, as my main credit card it's higher than the money I'm going to get paid or the minimum amount to pay it).  
Also trying to figure a way to get some money, I have some things I could try selling but it hurts me so much, my stuff :( So I don't know yet.

My mom came to apologize to me because we weren't talking after she figured out I was still playing and got mad, even if I was the one at fault, told her about what I'll have to pay in my cards, didn't mentioned NUMBERS but said that i'll have to pay multiple cards using each other.  
Not telling my boyfriend at the moment, just giving lame excuses as to why I don't have money for the last 8 months, can't deal with that right now if I'm being honest with you guys.

Been thinking about something that I could get addicted  to instead of bets, trying to think of anything that at least don't fuck my bank account but still have no idea, been playing some videogames to distract my brain.  
It's funny because before betting I was addicted to ritalin and before that I was addicted to weed. It seems like I always have some kind of addiction.

When I got bored I would always go into demo sites to play slots with free money just to see ""what would happen"" that would later make me deposit, opened the demo site 10 minutes ago, won't lie saying I didn't played for some time, but I just closed it because I noticed that the same way I lost fake money there, I would lose my real money.

I hope I can stay like that, I'm so afraid of getting to the 15th and doing a small deposit of $50 with the thought that ""it won't hurt"" and then losing everything I got paid again, I'm so so so so scared, even if it's my own actions, it is so hard... :(

Day 304: Sad reality: Casino parking lot near my house jammed on the 15th and 30th of month ,"Desperate people who just got paid will flood the parking lot on these dates hoping to be that 1 in a million getting their picture taken with a jackpot check. 

To make up for all the disappointment, heartache and misery that they have endured in the past. 

To give them that one shining moment that has never come, and unfortunately will never come. 

To me this is the clearest example of people caught in the cycle. They had no money until payday because they gamble, and the moment they get paid they can't wait to lose it once again. 

You just got paid, that is great! Instead of gambling, make a big payment to that credit card you have been ignoring calls from. Fix that loud exhaust noise from your wife's car she has begged you to help with. Hire a tutor to help your kid master that calculus equation that is beyond most everyone's capability, so she has a brighter future ahead. 

Feel better about yourself because you did not give into your baser instincts, and opted towards being the person you truly are. A giving, kind hearted person who cares for his and his family's future. and can look at himself in the mirror with pride.

Well it starts today ,"(23M) this is my third post over the last several days, I wish I just fully stopped after the first one. But I didn’t. So here I am. Several thousand more dollars down the drain.

At the end of it all, I finally stopped because my bank limits gave me no choice. 

Cleaned out my checkings as well as one of my savings accounts. Roughly 3k left of spending money that’s not invested or locked into something. Probably the least amount of on hand cash I’ve ever had in my life. 

I came clean to my mother about it all and finally self excluded from the online casinos. She handled it well and just emphasized she hoped I learnt my lesson. Apparently my father had a history of it himself too. 

I guess I just restart from here, I have a good job still and didn’t ruin any relationships other than the one with myself. 

It’s sad, on my days off I left my apartment literally one time. The rest of it spent rotting away on my couch gambling away money i worked day in and out for probably 5 months wages. 

I knew I had a problem before this nasty relapse, but I didn’t think I’d ever take it this far. Previous gambling binges only costing 2k to 5k in losses. This one costed me 25k in 3 measly days hardly eating and sleeping.

Another peaceful gamble free payday. Feeling happy this Thanksgiving.,"Not counting days but about 9 months since I came clean to my family and started the journey to quitting (self exclusuon, handing over finances, financial plan, therapy) and three months since my small relapse that taught me a lot.

Heading in to my long weekend for Thanksgiving (Canada), on my lunch break at work, and feeling very grateful for where I'm at right now. My marriage is good, we are trying for a second child, and rebuilding our financial goals. Work is good as I am ""checked in"" again. I feel myself again.

Wanted to share what a payday looks like now vs before in case it inspires anyone.

Before: try to have the day off or some of the day off, gamble to see how much money I'll have for the week, try to hide that I'm struggling with my financial responsibilities to my husband. Depending on how I do gambling and how many loans I have, go to bed either feeling a bit of relief if I win, my normal dread if I don't win but don't lose enough to be in a panic, or absolutely awful if I don't have enough left for loans and two more weeks before I try again.


Today: it's a normal work day, getting a lot done. Transferred some money to a friend for an upcoming girls cottage night. Made a few purchases we needed, but most of our shopping is already done. Grab a slice of pizza on my lunch running errands. Send my husband the majority of my pay which he will use toward household bills and life, leaving me with only what I'll need the next two weeks.

A helpful thought ,"I just wanted to share a helpful thought for me that has been helping recently. I’m on day 9 right now of stopping gambling so fairly new and a long road ahead but starting to feel more at peace with my journey and the facts of the destruction this disease has brought to me.

I gambled in secret, for me gambling was my own personal activity done sprawled across my couch in the darkness of my own apartment. It truly created the darkest days I’ve ever had and such feelings of stress and hatred when I couldn’t stop or control my betting. A lot of the time my line of thinking was that it was just me vs. the casino and I felt so excited about that 10% of the time I would come out ahead. Those rare times felt like a secret cheat code where I was printing money and that truly contributed to the excitement. However that line of thinking hides a greater truth. These casinos and companies didn’t just get this money out of thin air. So even in the instances that i came out ahead, i was“benefitting” from another persons loss. I was  participating in a system that is actively creating stress, anxiety, and terrible situations for people I hadnt met. I’ve come to the conclusion that I don’t want to participate in a system that’s creating so many problems and doling out the “worst days of your life” to people all across the world. Even when i personally benefit financially (which is extremely rare and not to be counted on) i was still actively creating suffering for others. That’s not something I want to continue doing.

Sharing because this empathy for others is something that I’m working on and this line of thinking is helping me realize that any participating in betting creates net negative outcomes for all. So don’t place that bet today. If you’re struggling about caring for yourself and your own situation, maybe a path to recovery is to care deeply about others as well.

I hardly think about gambling now, and when I do it’s always a negative feeling.

After 2 years my mom finally self-excluded,"In these two years i have never felt so relieved. Even though it might not be the end of it, I still feel like a rock dropped off my heart. 

Background story: My mom (F53) started gambling in May 2022. I (F23) live with my mum, because I study college. We also live with my brother (M31) and his girlfriend (F30). We found out about our mother’s gambling addiction on February 2023, because she didn’t pay the rent. She borrowed my momey to pay it. At this point she already lost 43 000 $.

Since then it only went downhill. She was always lying about money. I was borrowing her money, because I believed her, that she stopped gambling. Even though I cried and screamed at her for breaking the trust, she didn’t stopped gambling. It was difficult for me, because before all that she was my everything. We had great relationship, she was always listening and giving great advice. 

In August 2023 she went to my brother, asking him to pay debt (5 000$) that otherwise would make her go to jail. He did it and she continued to gamble. After that, she even stole my money (2100$). In July 2024 we found out she has bladder cancer, stage II. Later we found out she wasn’t paying rent and all her debts. Debt collectors were calling her every hour. At this time my dad, who hates her because she broke up with him, found out about her addiction and told everyone he could. I stopped talking to him since. 

Now she lost her new car, and all her dignity. We would have lost the house, if my brother didn’t pay for it. Yesterday I filled application for self-exclusion from all gambling sites and casinos that require identity check and gave it to her to send it, and she did.

You don’t have an edge ,"I don’t know how many of you have traded, but I’ve been doing it for over 4 years, and it’s what dragged me into this gambling addiction. Trading isn’t the calculated game they make it out to be—it’s pure addiction, and it gets worse with time. The constant highs and lows, the dopamine rush from a fast win, they mess with your head until your brain is wired to crave that thrill. It’s not just about money anymore; it becomes a need, a relentless urge that takes over your life.

People will tell you that your risk management is wrong, that you don’t have an edge, that you need to be more disciplined. It’s all a lie. The addiction deepens with time, and so do the losses. The odds are stacked against you from the start—90% fail, and even the so-called 10% who make it are barely scraping by on what amounts to an average salary. This isn’t the life-changing opportunity they sell you; it’s a trap.

Anything that’s a numbers game with quick wins is a dangerous drug. It pulls you in, giving you just enough hope to keep you hooked while it drains you. The rush becomes your normal, and the risk stops feeling like risk—it just feels like a part of you. But in the end, the game chews you up, and it doesn’t care if you break.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g168r5/you_dont_have_an_edge/,8,4,1728640889.0
Gambling industry profits,Are you aware that 95% of gambling profits come from gambling addicts? People that continuously play their games? They come from YOU.

Let's never gamble again and drive these thieves out of business. Do to them as they have done to you.

Gamble responsibly!,"The concept of “responsible gambling” is a sham, a lie spun by casinos, betting companies, and stock brokers to shift the blame onto players instead of facing their own role in creating addicts. They push the idea that it’s on you to control your behavior, but the reality is far darker. I’ve seen people gamble “responsibly” for years—until that one bad year dragged them into total wreckage. Gambling is an addiction that only digs deeper over time. There’s no such thing as “responsible gambling”—just a ticking time bomb.

This isn’t just about losing money; it’s about how gambling hijacks your brain. The constant highs of a win and the crushing lows of a loss mess with your brain’s chemistry, rewiring your dopamine receptors until they’re fried. Dopamine, the chemical that makes you feel good, gets completely twisted. The thrill of a win or the panic of a loss floods your brain with dopamine, but the more you gamble, the more you need those extreme highs just to feel anything at all. It leaves you numb to everything else, and you get trapped, chasing that next rush because everyday life doesn’t cut it anymore.

Some people are even more vulnerable to this trap—those with ADHD, addictive personalities, and inflated egos who think they can outsmart the system. They believe they’re in control, but the truth is, the game is rigged against them. It exploits every weakness, pulling them deeper and deeper into the pit. This isn’t a habit you can manage or control; it’s a system that’s designed to break you down, one bet at a time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g153cy/gamble_responsibly/,22,10,1728635558.0

day 1 again and again and again and again...,"DAY 1. here I am, yet again.  
it feels so stupid not being able to feel anything after seeing your bank extract and all the deposits you made within 30 minutes. I could be so much more, but still, I'm this stupid person.

not been talking properly to my mom ever since she found out, that was 4 months ago, when I started working on a new job and promised to myself  that I would pay, thinking ""I just need to behave for 3 months and I'll be done with this sick disease and debts, I can do that"".  
1st payday of work: made some bets, got some profit and was able to pay one of the banks that I was owing, from that, you guys know how it goes, right?  
so I never stopped, I lied to everyone around me, I lied even to myself, I lost everything that I got (even my paywage) and got some more debts in different banks, I'm still working, I'm still not having anything because I pay for the credit cards and then lose it all again.  
only my mom and dad knows this, I have a boyfriend who doesn't have IDEA.

strange thing is that when my mom found out I didn't felt so bad, it seems like ever since this addiction started, I'm not being able to feel things properly, I thought that seeing her cry would make me open my eyes, I thought that losing everything would make me wake up, but it didn't, and that sucks.

so I'm here now, after losing everything I got on 30th of september, a money that was supposed to be my paywage, 15th of this month I have $2000 of credit card to pay and I'll only be getting $1100 from work on that same day, so I'm planning to pay a part of the card, then use it to pay some other cards, then use the other cards to be able to pay the full amount, sucks but yeah.

not spending it on myself, not giving my mom gifts as I used to in the past, not doing anything fun with my boyfriend or getting little things to him, not going out with my friends.

THAT IS SO STUPID :|

i'll be trying again, as today, this is my new day one.  
the bad part is that the app gamban blocks my valorant, the  only game I play sometimes, so I uninstalled it has been quite some time.  
thank you guys for always sharing your feelings, hope you guys stay strong.

ps: telling my boyfriend is not an option in this case, he will break up with me because we talked about this sort of stuff in the past, and if he breaks up with me, I'm by myself, not even a single soul that I talks beside him, being sad and alone will probably just make me want to bet more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g0zfkl/day_1_again_and_again_and_again_and_again/,7,12,1728612961.0
Next steps after finally admitting to yourself you’re a compulsive gambler?,"I always suspected this about myself the last year or so but this week really opened my eyes. 

Background: I am a 30 (m) and discovered gambling online mostly during COVID. I would win some and lose some and usually lose some more. It’s been like that a couple years until I moved close to a casino (not intentionally) and realized how a real in person casino is like where if you win you can cash out real money and go to the bank and deposit it unlike online casinos where you have to send endless documents and proof of payment. 

In April at the casino I won a considerable jackpot and immediately cashed out and went to my bank to deposit it thinking I was in control. Fast forward a month I gave it all back and more. I decided to self exclude from the casino (also still feeling in control) where if I went there after signing the paperwork I could be charged with trespassing and would not be awarded any jackpots.  

I decided to take a break from gambling which was hard the first couple months because I think the dopamine rush kept my 9-5 life feel less boring but I did it. But all my cool down periods online ended after 6 months and I fell into temptation. 

The past couple months I guess you can call it a relapse where there is this one online casino I was already verified and I hit a jackpot (I don’t think I can say the amount on here but it was a couple thousand) and when I hit withdrawal in about 10 minutes the amount was in my bank account. 

I went to bed excited and thinking of how I can use this money (put towards debt, savings etc.), but stupidly gave every single cent back being greedy and trying to get more the next day. 

After 3 hours I snapped out of it and realized what’s I’ve done and felt shame, guilt, and dark thoughts. For the first time in a while with my battle with depression and suicidal thoughts crept in. 

Then I did some research and self reflection and thought I could have won over $10,000 last night and probably would’ve gave it all back and finally accepted that I am a compulsive gambler. No jackpot would ever be enough. So I told myself there is no point in gambling if even if I win I give it all back. As crazy as that sounds, it had really helped. I don’t think I can be the person who casually gambles because it triggers something in me and I end up off the rails. 

I am sick of the past couple months getting my paycheque and most of it going to online gambling and payday loans when I ran out of money just to gamble. 

Please don’t leave negative comments, I just want to know if any of you have had similar experiences and when your ‘gambling isn’t worth it’ moment sinked in. I don’t want to do Gamblers Anonymous because I am not religious and don’t feel comfortable in group settings.

Im a compulsive gambler (Rant),"Knowing that I am a compulsive gambler has made all the difference in making it easier for me to resist. I now believe wholeheartedly that we are not like normal people who can casually gamble. Any amount that we put in is gone, period. We will never sell the top and if we do we will never cash out. We will ape another shit coin and ride it to zero because we think we're going to 5x that money. We will never walk away when we are up etc. we are compulsive gamblers.

Telling the truth,"Speaking the truth is a powerful thing.  The last 5 years of my life I have struggled with a gambling addiction.  Going completely broke many times.  Just this past December I lost everything and racked up 31,000 dollars in credit card debt.  Even throughout this journey of paying back for my mistakes and working 60 hour weeks I have fell off the wagon.  I kept this secret from everyone.  I was too embarrassed to tell the truth.  That I would never be looked at the same.  But just this past week I finally confessed to my girlfriend of three years.  I told her I have been paying back my debts the past 9 months and it explained why I was so irritable and certain behaviors I was dealing with.  I honestly think there is no better way to deal with this then tell someone you love.  Tell someone you don’t want to disappoint, someone who will support.  My girlfriend was dumbfounded at first.  She couldn’t understand how this all happened.  And she told me I had to promise this will never happen again.  I can promise all I want.  But I cannot get sympathy from this if I repeat my actions.  I needed help and now I am plain out asking for it.  I was always afraid she would look at me differently so I didn’t change our lifestyle whatsoever and tried to put my pieces together on their own.  But it was too much.

I couldn’t handle it any longer, my emotions were dragging each and every day and it came to a breaking point.  Bursting into tears and I couldn’t even get out what I wanted to say because it felt so detrimental.  I understand the significance of telling her and now I feel I have the responsibility of not only myself but my SO as well right in my very hands.  I will not ever gamble on anything ever again.  No fantasy football or $5 bets.  I cannot handle my addictive personality to manage my finances.  

Just tell the truth.  Speak to someone.  For so long I felt like I couldn’t talk to anyone because of how stupid I am.  Given it took me 9 months and 13,000 dollars to feel like I was able to ask for help.  I am not one to talk but I am on a journey to better myself and create a life worth living.  17,500 dollars to go and I am staying optimistic.  Things will fall in place as long as you are determined, have strong will & heart.  Believe in yourself you can all do it.  Get 1% better each and every day.

Warning to All Gamblers: The Recession Has Already Begun – Get Out While You Can,"The recession is here, and it’s coming for everything you have. The markets are already buckling, jobs are being cut left and right, and prices are climbing like there’s no tomorrow. Your gambling habit? It’s not just a bad decision anymore—it’s a death sentence for your future. Keep betting, keep fooling yourself, and you’re going to find yourself on the street with nothing but regret to keep you company.

Think you’re safe? Think again. When the economy tanks, casinos don’t care about your losses—they’ll keep taking your money until they bleed you dry. Online, in person, doesn’t matter. They don’t care about your bills, your rent, your family. They’ll take your last cent and spit you out. And when you’re sitting in the dark, wondering how you’re going to keep the heat on or buy groceries, remember every dollar you flushed away hoping for that “big win” that never came.

This is your last chance to save yourself. The money you’re gambling with right now? It’s not play money—it’s survival money. It’s the money that’ll keep your family fed when everything else falls apart. It’s the money that’ll make sure your car stays on the road, that your power stays on, that you have a roof over your head when the storm hits hardest. Every bet you place is you taking that money and lighting it on fire.

You think you’re stressed now? Imagine what happens when you lose your job and your savings are gone because you couldn’t quit. Imagine telling your family that there’s no money left for food, for bills, because you gambled it away thinking you could beat the odds. You won’t just lose cash—you’ll lose trust, you’ll lose respect, and you’ll lose the very people who counted on you to protect them.

The recession doesn’t care about your luck, and neither do the bookies or the casinos. They know the house always wins, and they’re just waiting for you to keep throwing away what little you have left. The only way you walk away with anything is if you stop gambling now and start saving whatever you can.

You’re out of time. This isn’t about chasing some dream of a big win anymore—it’s about survival. Cut your losses, shut down the apps, delete the numbers, walk away from the tables. Put every dollar into savings like your life depends on it—because it does.

Day 8- it was going well…,Well I thought I’d be more excited this many days bet free and things would be looking up...well I just talked to my wife and had to tell her we are paycheck to paycheck and her facial expression said it all. L She also said “ I hate that I get reminded that” It has put me in a dark state. So dark I think I could give up on life at any point. Me leaving the world would make her and our daughters financially stable forever. If this is the sacrifice I have to take for my consequences/actions and have my family safe for life then why not? To me it doesn’t make sense to stick around. Every time we talk debt or what not it always turns negative.

Day 2: Recognize + Rebalance,"It was officially day two yesterday, and my first reality is accountability. I labeled my “Day Zero” post as “Day One”. To some this is a small oversight, and it is to me as well. But I am addressing my mistake and getting on track by labeling this post with the accurate date.

Another thing. This post is coming in the AM the next day. This is because I listened to my body and caught up on sleep.

Because of this addiction my sleep schedule has been all over the place. I had nights where I lost a bet on the American prime time games, then resorted to Asian baseball games. I would set alarms an hour after I placed the bets. Groggy, checking the score. I assure you this did nothing to help me. I lost, lost, and lost again. Winners happened and maybe I would rest until I needed to get ready. Other times I would make it to sunrise betting, switching bets back to whatever basketball games were starting (my preferred bet). I would sometimes ride the app all day, losing heaps of money. I think the amount is irrelevant, it was a lot. It was money I shouldn’t be burning through. But I also want others to recognize that it shouldn’t be a battle of who can lose the most when talking about this addiction. 

To say the least, my bodily appearance changed, dark circles present under my eyes, a lack of full hygiene (I would even bring my phone into the shower to watch scores and my bets). Sometimes I would skip brushing my teeth out of stress and being glued to my phone. Fiscal loses snd health loses. Sounds like a disaster to anyone except an addict chasing their loses.

This changed yesterday. I went to bed early. My phone was not present. The impulse to bet was not present. I slept over 8 hours. I woke up, felt more present, and am typing to this community today in a journal like nature. I’m making the change, and you can too. 

You can do it, we’re rooting for you. If you read to here thank you. Your time is appreciated.

I encourage others to add words of encouragement in the comments, or if you’re having struggles, feel free to chime in here or create your own thread. We’re a community that can and will build each other up.

Good tip if you're gambling online!,"So I've been wasting money for years. Never had a $ to my name. I live in a country where there is no live casinos, so I only use online casinos, or crypto casinos. Year after year I ended up using every penny and wins were only temporary and my bank balance always ended up at 0$ in the end.



It all changed 4 months ago, I asked my bank to BLOCK all crypto and gambling transactions. Now, on several occasions I've tried to deposit with my card on bet365, unibet or buy crypto with Moonpay, Binance, Kraken, Coinbase. Failed every time.

"I messed up bad, and I don't know how to fix it anymore.","Hey everyone,

I’m in a really dark place right now and could use some advice because I honestly don’t know what to do anymore.

About a month ago, I admitted to my fiancé that I relapsed (addiction-related), and he’s been furious ever since. It’s been weeks, and he still reminds me every day how much he despises me, which, honestly, I understand. I feel like I’ve shattered his trust completely.

On top of that, I owe his parents around $2,300, and I can’t pay them back. I used to manage my own funds, but now my fiancé controls all my money, and he has no idea about the loan I took from his parents. Today, his parents called me demanding the money, and I just felt the pit in my stomach grow deeper because I have nothing to give them. They were angry, and I can’t blame them. I feel like I’m drowning in the mess I’ve made.

I feel like I’ve ruined everything. I’ve been thinking a lot about death lately, even looking into life after death because I’m terrified but also feel like it might be better than all of this. I don’t know if there’s a way out of this or if I’ve just dug myself too deep.

Please, I need advice. I’m desperate for help and don't know what to do anymore. Is there any way to fix this? Or is it too late?

Steps on stopping?,"I’m 19 years old have a severe problem with knowing when to quit. Started a couple years ago on my states skill games in gas stations. A couple months ago I started using a credit line gambling sight and have been down 500 every week for the past 6 or 7 weeks. Today I won enough to probably break even all together from past weeks. But I didn’t stop there less then 30 minutes later i was playing more blackjack trying to profit more, lost it all once again. I truly cannot stop myself from playing my brain just gets wired.I play every chance i can even at work. Feel it’s really fucking my brain chemistry.

Looking for some encouragement after a slip,"So here's the story. I'll try to make it short, since goodness knows, no one wants to read a 15 page narrative. I was 360 days clean. I had to go to Las Vegas for a work trip (couldn't get out of it). I had some down time and found myself in a casino where i had some free play offers. I've done this before, just run through my free play and hand it off to my wife. I won $500 off the free play. 

And then I couldn't resist. I put the $500 back in, ran it up to $2000, then down to zero. 

I know many of you will say that it doesn't really matter, since the $500 was the casino's anyway, but once I ran through the free play, that money was mine. It was real and I gambled it away. 

More importantly was how I felt. I felt such relief at being able to PLAY again, even if just for a bit. That's what's worrying me. The thought that, despite my commitment to my recovery, what I really want, deep down, is to be able to PLAY. 

I didn't reach for more, thankfully, but I've been utterly depressed since that day.

Decent poker player but it’s controlling me,"I am a good poker player. I was out again tonight at the casino from 7pm-2am in a poker tournement and came in top 3. 

The problem isn’t about the money always. It’s the fact I finish work and go there and it affects my sleep, my family relationship and my life chores stack up. 

Sometimes I’ll feel like it’s worth it but I end up feeling like shit in the drive home especially on loosing nights. 

I stopped for a couple months then I played online, got a bit lucky in a low stakes tournement then it sent me back to my multiple nights a week at the casino mentality. 

I don’t want to do poker full time so it’s not an option for me, infact I don’t like socialising all that much and it makes me uncomfortable or just exhausted listening to people go on all night about what someone should have done.

Poker is glamorised everywhere so it’s hard sometimes to think it’s a bad thing, tomorrow I intend on giving up. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g07b3d/decent_poker_player_but_its_controlling_me/,6,5,1728522544.0
Day 521: Find a support System and get people in your corner,"Everyday you choose to abstain from gambling is considered a win. Recovery is not one size fits alls. Everyone’s recovery is going to look different. Do what works for you, don’t do what doesn’t. Find out your triggers, replace them with good habits or hobbies. Talk to others going through similar issues. Build or join a community of humans ( I say humans because we make mistakes, we’re not perfect, nor should we try to be. If anything we should try to be better than we were the day before). Seek out professional help with therapists, specifically gambling addiction specialist. If sports are a trigger, find something more productive to do than sitting around on your phone, watching sports. 

I started a discord server few months back for those looking to connect with others struggling with a gambling addiction. You’re not alone.

Day after my first Gamblers anonymous meeting 🧵 ,"Attended my first GA meeting last night. There was about 12 other men there (I was the youngest, 34) and they each shared their story and a couple also shared their experience attending their first meeting. Ngl, I was nervous walking in especially not knowing what to expect. All i know is that I had to give it a shot because nothing else has worked. I was still pretty raw, plus i have issues dealing with emotions so I sat there and listened mostly, read a couple paragraphs when asked to while trying to keep myself together. 

The guys seem to know exactly what I was going through and all had nice things to say. They asked my about 12 questions which I answered ""yes"" to all and then welcomed me to the fellowship. In my 4 year stint of crypto and gambling on shit coins it had never occurred to me that I could have been a compulsive gambler. But it all makes sense now. It was nice being around people who share the same... idk, goal? To never gamble again. 
It was nice having 60 year old wise men congratulating me on making the best decision of my life... one old timer even said I've hit the jack pot but I just don't know it yet. I guess we'll see. Anyway, I sat all that to say this...

I feel refreshed. I feel like I now have the blueprint to stop gambling and all that comes with it. I see the light at the end of the tunnel. They say it a life long battle so I shall sharpen my sword daily. 

I will admit. My biggest obstacle is that every now and again I think of the debt I owe and it makes me angry inside. I'll take a few breaths and try to shake it off. And I look forward to the day where I can pay my dad back in full. 

Good luck bros

PointsBet or DraftKings in Michigan ,"First I just want to say that I understand what folks are going through on this sub.  This disease wrecks all parts of life.  The only reason I'm posting here is because I struggle with problem gambling myself.  I know that it is our responsibility to manage ourselves, but at the same time casinos and sports books need to follow the law - particularly laws that are in place to help protect users like us.


With that, here is the situation...

DraftKings and PointsBet have potentially violated patron protection laws in Michigan and I am looking to see if anyone has had the following experiences that I have also had.  

Specifically, has anybody here set up self-imposed limits (time, deposits, wager amounts ) and then subsequently raised them?  I.e. set limit of $200/month and then raised it to $300/month?

Michigan requires 24 hours for these increases to go into effect and DraftKings and PointsBet seemingly ignored this requirement.   They used to allow immediate increases.   As all of us know delaying gambling is a huge step to not gambling.  The 24 hour rule is meant to help us delay and hopefully not gamble at all.  

If you think that you have had this experience would you please DM me?  I am just trying to find other users like me that have experienced this because we might - MIGHT - have legitimate claims against DraftKings and PointsBet.  There are no guarantees in this and I am not trying to give false hope or legal advice.  Finding others like me is just the first step in potentially holding DraftKings and PointsBet accountable for violating the law.    Something might come from this, or nothing might.  

If you live somewhere other than Michigan, but have a similar experience, would you please DM me too.  Some other states have similar laws to Michigan.

Thanks all for listening and God bless.  One day at a time.    ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fzyx23/pointsbet_or_draftkings_in_michigan/,0,9,1728499717.0

·         I am grateful that I know I made mistakes yesterday, and the wise thing to do is to reflect on and learn from them instead of dwell on them.

·         I am grateful I could share my experience with an ex co-worker yesterday who seemed like he needed help managing his emotions. I’m by no means an expert but I think I may have helped him, which felt good.

·         I am grateful that I’m learning each day how to recognize what I identify with and remember who I really am.

·         I am grateful that managing stressful feelings inside is not a strength currently – I still resort to compulsive habitual eating patterns to avoid facing anxiety head on.

·         I am grateful for the opportunities today to accept what’s happening inside and outside and let go of all of the extra drama.

·         I am grateful to see that these daily challenges are a part of life, but its ultimately me who decides whether they are struggles or if they are opportunities for growth.

How do I tell him I know,"Throwaway. I’ve been with my sweet husband for 6 years now. He’s the love of my life, but his problem gambling has been a massive struggle the past few years. We have 6-figure debt, but we’re slowly digging ourselves out of the hole since we’re both high earners. 

The gambling comes in waves. He won’t do it for months, then suddenly he finds a way through the barriers I’ve set up and he loses a bunch of money again. I patch those holes up and we move forward. I always hope the last time was the last time. 

I’m in my late 20s, so being this deep in financial shit I didn’t create can be hard. I’ve always felt that we’re okay though, mainly because he has always been honest with me when he gambles. He tells me within hours, if not minutes. I have access to every account he has, so I can verify that he hasn’t hidden anything.

Except today I found out that he’s been gambling for months without telling me. Long story on how, but he got access to a gambling site and a large chunk of money. I earned that money. Before it came to me, I confessed to him that I was scared to get it. I knew it would help with our debt, but I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to keep it safe. He promised he would never do that to me. 

Today, all the small suspicious things I’ve been brushing off hit me like a truck. I checked on some things, and now I know that thousands of dollars are gone. I can’t bring myself to add up all the charges. I don’t want to know. 

I am at a loss. I sat in the office all day in a daze. I’m home now. He doesn’t know I know. I feel like this changes everything. It’s a deep, deep betrayal. 

Sorry for the rambling. I don’t even know what I’m asking for, exactly. How can I tell him? I know that when I do, everything changes forever. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fzcqex/how_do_i_tell_him_i_know/,1,1,1728427202.0

Introspective thoughts about the addiction,"Thoughts while high

It catches you, man. OCD. I used to unlock and re-lock my car 10+ times after parking it and before entering a building. I can see myself staring at the screen. Slots. Check balance. Check bet amount. Check result. You get lost in it. ""This spin paid that much. What if it pays THAT much?"" ""It's on a downward trend, what's the upward trend gonna be?"" ""Does this and that symbol connect and how much does that pay?"" 

That is how it wraps you up and traps you and becomes a compulsive addiction. 

At a street light,

""It's red, I will slow down.""

""Pedestrians on that corner, make sure to watch out for them.""

""I wonder what the score of that one game is. Didn't I have a parlay on it?""

""Yeah I can check the box score once I park.""

\*park car\*

""Oh man it's looking good so far, imagine how it will feel when that bet hits!""

It infiltrates itself into every aspect of your life. This is how it gets you. 

I truly understand when people say ""One day at a time."" It goes without saying, one thought at a time. One action at a time.

10 months have passed. 3 major lapses. It ALWAYS, ALWAYS creeps back with one thought. And the follow up thought. And the follow up action. And the repetitive, compulsive thoughts and actions that it brings with it.

""Hey this XXX season started, what's the harm of putting X amount on it? Wouldn't it be fun to win again?""

""NO. There's evidence you have a problem and it won't stop there.""

\^\^\^(I wish is how I would have responded to myself about it)

Instead it's usually ""Yeah, that wouldn't be so bad, that X amount won't hurt me right?""

BE VIGILANT and CHECK YOURSELF on how you think about things and your self-talk. Along with GA, your family and friends who TELL YOU and REINFORCE the things you need to hear to not get WRAPPED UP IN IT again are giving you ammunition to be able to stop those creeping thoughts from leading to actions and then into a compulsive state again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fzn5rt/introspective_thoughts_about_the_addiction/,3,1,1728465064.0

Got my monthly salary and actually bought myself something good for once. Recovery.,"Last month I essentially had a crisis, I did the very thing I told myself I would never do and that was to gamble my rent and bills money. After scrambling for a few weeks to make up enough money to pay my rent and bills I recognised I had a problem.

People that aren't addicts do not full knowingly gamble their rent and bills money for the month. It was a slap in the face as it crossed a boundary of mine and it highlighted I was in perilous territory.

  
Something has switched since then, I can only say I chose a new identity, one free of gambling. It's early days, the urges are there but not near the same intensity, I'm now able to catch myself in the moment, I even spent some a bit of money on items for the home to make it more desirable to me, feels good doing something good for myself and treating myself well rather than abusing myself through gambling.

"Day 2: Hurt, Reality, and Realization","TW: Financial Loss, Loans, depression

Here we are day two, and I feel small, tiny, and have experienced temptation and urges. I have looked at my bank account with anger, and my impulse is to take the little scraps left and put it onto the app again.

Not this time, or hopefully ever, I will be fine, I will be okay. Only if I stay away. If I do not, even more hurt will be coming this way. Last month my mortgage payment was barely met. And by barely, I mean the rainy day fund coming to the rescue. With that money I took a small amount that was deposited, lost, rinse and repeat that same amount 3/4 times, and I went from 3 mortgage emergency payments to 1 in addition to half of my final deposit. I feel remorse, I feel regret, but I know I did the right thing by withdrawing that money. It showed that I am accepting loss and I will power through to the other side.

I have a loan that I have to pay, that will be paid with the upcoming paychecks along with other necessities. Life will get better. Eventually paying off debt slowly will allow me to save again and be me again. 

These are just my running thoughts as today has progressed. I get to look forward to tidying up my apartment and spending time with my wife and dog. 

Thanks for anyone who has read this all the way through. We will make it out.

Why Gamblers Addicts Can’t Walk Away,"it’s never about the money—it’s about the high, the adrenaline, the rush of feeling like the universe is bending in your favor. You see, when you win, especially big, your brain is flooded with a rush of dopamine, a high that feels like nothing else in the world. That feeling makes everything else—responsibility, self-control, the future—fade into the background. It’s like a drug, one that convinces you that you’re invincible, that maybe you’ve finally cracked the code and luck is on your side.

So when you win, that high is at its peak, and your brain isn’t telling you to cash out and walk away with your profits. It’s screaming at you to keep chasing that feeling, to keep riding the wave. You think you’re on top, and deep down, part of you believes that you can keep it going forever. You’re not walking away because, in that moment, it feels like walking away means leaving more potential wins on the table. You start thinking, “If I just push a little further, I’ll win even more.”

But here’s the sick irony: the more you win, the more you start to believe you need to keep going. That big win rewires your brain, it convinces you that this time is different, that you can keep beating the odds. And when you start losing again—which always happens—it’s not just the money you’re losing; it’s that rush, that sense of power. And suddenly, you’re back to chasing, trying to reclaim that fleeting feeling of being untouchable.

In those moments, you’re not in control anymore—your brain is hijacked. It’s wired to crave that dopamine hit, even if it means watching every last dollar slip away. It’s like being at the top of a rollercoaster, and instead of stepping off safely, you’re strapping in for another ride, telling yourself, “Just one more time, it’ll be even better.” And you keep doing it until there’s nothing left.

That’s why gamblers don’t walk away, even when they win—because it’s not just about the money. It’s about chasing a high that leaves you feeling more empty, more desperate every time it slips away. It’s a trap, a cycle that feeds on itself, dragging you deeper until the money is gone, the rush is gone, and all that’s left is that hollow, sickening feeling of having thrown it all away. And then you find yourself back at square one, trying to figure out how to win back what’s already lost.

And the scariest part? Every win just reinforces that cycle, makes the chains around your mind tighter. It takes a hell of a lot more than a few good runs to break free of that kind of prison.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fzbpna/why_gamblers_addicts_cant_walk_away/,18,7,1728424416.0
I relapsed but could stop myself,"Hello fellow compulsive gamblers,

On 17th of September on a beautiful, sunny day when everything was going unusually well in my life, I decided to gamble for which I will probably never forgive myself. I was chasing my 2k loss from the previous year. Long story short, I lost another 2k in one night that my parent really worked hard for and saved for my expenses. I was ashamed of myself, the pain was quite intense and I could not sleep well for a few days and couldn't concentrate on my studies. On my mind constantly were questions like - ""How could you? Why did you do it despite losing 2k last year? Why did you think this time would be different?""

Today, despite all the warning on this thread, I succumbed to temptation once again and found myself in the casino. I played 20 euros made it to 30, then it fell to 20 again and then I could manage to cash out. It was a huge relief and victory for me to return home with no loss, that I did not put 100 euros which was in my wallet into the slot machine.   
  
Because the warnings people share here was in mind constantly. ""Losing your future, losing your sanity and friends etc."" So I want to thank you guys for informing other how bad this addiction is. My next goal is to attend to GA meeting tomorrow and hopefully never visit any casino again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fza3du/i_relapsed_but_could_stop_myself/,8,3,1728420209.0

I've been playing with fire for so long,"I've always had a gambling problem. I thought I had it under control in the past but it was actually just not having more money to gamble that stopped me. I've been broke several times because of gambling. Then I started to get my life together and got a career going and whatnot. I got married to a wonderful woman. Had a baby. Life was good.  


for a few years the gambling was ""manageable,"" just playing with some ""extra"" funds I had hidden away. Then the losses started to snowball and accumulate much faster than I could come up with ""extra' money. Cash advance on cc is treated like another ATM withdraw. Took out multiple personal loans. I actually paid some off in full when I had a good run and won money. But soon I would need another loan to cover the bigger losses that followed. I started taking money from the joint savings account that only I had access to. My wife thinks we have a sizeable savings account built up. I have depleted the entire thing. Shamefully, I have even taken money out of my child's college fund. I have hit rock bottom. Yet I continue to gamble.

Gambling is interfering with every aspect of my life. I am probably on the verge of losing my job. Pretty soon the whole thing will blow up when she asks for money from the joint account for a big purchase that we have planned in a few months. The lies will become exposed. 

I had some really dark thoughts this year. Yes, I've contemplated suicide many times. I figured at least the life insurance money will take care of the debt and the shortfall I've created for my family.  I can ""run away"" from the shame and guilt. I'm being chickenshit, not wanting to deal with actually trying to fix things.   
  
But when I look at my kid, it breaks my heart. I don't want my child to grow up without a father. I've been wrestling with this for several months. Now I have at least made up my mind that I'm not going to end my life. 

But now what?   
  
Do I come clean to my wife? She will be devasted by all the lies. There will be no trust left. But it's the first step toward making things right? I don't know how to come back from this so I just keep digging a bigger hole.

Why Can't Gamblers Walk Away and Stop gambling Even When They Win?,"Hi all - I am a gambling addict and still coming to terms with it all, and very curious in understanding the science and psychology of this disease.

A hallmark/classic feature of gambling addiction is 1) gamblers chasing losses and 2) gamblers literally unable to stop gambling, even when they have won. Gamblers will gamble and gamble and gamble, regardless of winning or losing, until they simply have no money left to gamble.

I understand the psychology of a gambler losing and chasing losses, but it is harder for me to understand how - when a gambler is actually profitable and has made money, why gamblers can't simply walk way.

I am looking for any comments, input, feedback on the psychology/science of this addiction specific to why gamblers can't freaking walk away - even when they have made money.

237 Days and reflecting on where I was and where I am now,"This is the longest I have gone without gambling in quite a few years. Probably since 2017! and wow... It's unimaginable to believe that looking back, that I would have such a issue with gambling and that it would effect my life in many negative ways.

I didn't really know I had an issue until some time in 2019, where I found myself consistently going to roulette tables straight after work on payday. I would put $50-$200+ in and not really bat an eye because whether I lost it or not it didn't really have consequences at that time as I was living with my parents, I got fed and had a roof over my head and had little expenses. Over time the draw of gambling got bigger, it had it's moments but were always and inevitably overshadowed by the losses. I would start getting into a bad mood often and my paycheck would vanish instantly each week.

  
Covid eventually came around and really isolated me from friends and family, I had a lung illness and was starting to get really sick and with the fear of covid wiping me out looming, I started to get intense anxiety and stress which led me to drinking a lot, most nights of the week, further making me sick and anxious. Many times I would ask friends and family for money and I would lie for what I would use it for. I ended up having a list of people I owed money too, upwards of 8 or more people. I always knew I would pay them back but I would put it straight back into the machines and end up digging myself a deeper hole and I would repeat this over and over, losing faith and trust in those around me. I think my friendships are forever damaged but I'm lucky to have a few that stuck around.

  
Eventually after many set backs, borrowing money and seeing new lows in myself, I knew that I had to really take quitting serious and so I self excluded from every gambling venue in my state and also from many online casinos. Unfortunately this wasn't a permanent fix, just a band-aid solution but it did help, it was part of the solution. I was and still am missing something in life and no matter how many band-aid solutions I have I know I won't be able to heal unless I repair what I am missing.

  
I'm now on a journey to lead a more fulfilling life, I can't say for sure it's the answer but with the small improvements I'm making it's quite easy to not even think about gambling. I'm not a fool I know not to think I'm safe and cured from the addiction but I think I'm taking the right steps.

During my journey I've managed to pay off some of my debts, with only two more left which I hope to have paid off in half a year.

I have managed to find a rental by myself for the first time with just me and my cat. I saved a good amount of money for a rental deposit and a bunch of furniture and big grocery shop with money to spare.

I'm working hard to have some emergency savings and paying off my debts.

  
My friends and I are connecting more often for movie nights, parties or board game nights.

I'm performing well at work and am a well respected member in the team.

I've taken steps to eat healthier and work out more often for a healthier mind and body.

I give myself monthly goals to work towards, such as read a book, find a cafe, get a new haircut, go to a movie, start a new hobby. It gives me something to look forward to and achieve.

Personally I believe I lack drive and meaning, I have little confidence and don't get out as much as I would like, so I've decided to volunteer to help people, Ill gain new skills, meet like minded people, be out in the field doing something meaningful and I'll be able to help those that might be having a shit day have at least a better day.

I'm a lot better than I was last year and the years before but I know I have so much to improve on. I want to be a better person, someone people can rely on and to make their day better, to make people laugh.

There are days where I am way too hard on myself and judge myself harshly but I forget that I should re-evaluate and look back at where I was and where I am now.

This doesn't even cover the ""social"" casino apps where you buy coins to gamble with then can redeem the coins for cash that are all over the App Store.

Keep going, and you’ll see what real rock bottom feels like. But the truth is, in gambling, there is no rock bottom—just a deeper, darker place waiting for you every time you think you’ve hit the lowest point.

Imagine yourself a year from now. You think the shame, the guilt, and the fear you feel today is bad? Wait until you’ve lost more than you thought possible—your money, your home, the trust of everyone around you, maybe even your sanity. You’ll be trapped in a nightmare of your own making, screaming for a way out that never comes. Every sleepless night, every lie you tell, every time you hope for that miracle win—it’s all just a step closer to a life where hope doesn’t exist anymore.

Gambling doesn’t care about your life. It’s a monster that feeds on your desperation and will leave you with nothing but emptiness. Keep feeding it, and it will devour everything—your family, your friends, your future. And when it’s done with you, you’ll be left alone, staring into a void that you created, wondering how you let it get this far.

Or you can stop. Right now. You can pull yourself out of this nightmare before it swallows you whole. It’s not going to be easy, but it’s your only chance.

What can we do?,"If we really want to stop? We can start by telling ourselves the truth that we are a compulsive gambler and there is no hot streak big enough or long enough to satisfy our appetite, that no loss will go unchased or doubled down, or tilted because we are hooked. 

We can accept that we need help and we can start moving forward knowing this doesn't have to be an isolated and pitiful journey where we are just living as a shell of ourselves, existing to gamble and hide it from the world around us. 

What else can we do to get clean? We can tell someone close to us that we trust that we have a gambling problem preferably someone who can play an active role in helping us hold ourselves accountable. 

We can go to GA to share and learn from like minded individuals. We can give a trusted person acess to our bank accounts, crypto accounts, anything and everything of value that we have including credit cards. We can self exclude from places and websites to make it a bit more inconvenient to gamble when the urges strike. 

Yes there are ways around these measures but if we are serious about stopping these can be helpful guardrails. We can not expect we will stop because of one action we take on one day. There is always some way to gamble. Only we can decide if we are doing to do it or not. Society, the government, private companies etc. owe us nothing. We owe it to ourselves and our loved ones to stop.

This is going to be a lifetime commitment and anything we do will not be fool proof or cut and dry or a silver bullet to stop gambling. Each day we do what we can, and do the best we can to not gamble for today. We can worry about tomorrow when it arrives.  Living a better life is worth it. The solution is inside of us.

I have had to accept his addiction because if I don't then I don't care about his happiness. I agreed to his terms which was 100 a month. 25$ a week to gamble. It's still not enough. He's been asking for more and more and makes me feel guilty if I don't give in. He's also part of a gambling community where everyone  enables each other. 

These past three days he has completely ignored me and I could feel it coming so I locked my cards.  I woke up to a message from him saying he's sorry and that he doesn't know what he's doing and needs to stop sacrificing his time with me for gambling. I know that's all bullshit. Sure it had meaning at the time but I know all too well that moment fades as soon as the next spam email comes in. Hours and hours wasted. It's all he does. I miss him. I want to feel important to him. I want my husband back. It's also affecting our son. He has seen some nasty arguments this year.

I love him. I stay. I choose to stay because I know he's still in there. I know there's still part of him that loves me. But this has taken over a couple of years now. This has taken priority. 

I'm a fucking mess. I'm tired of hiding my wallet. I bought a combination lock wallet and he found a way into that so I need a recommendation for something he won't be able to get into. Sure I locked my cards but I had cash in there and he took 100$ and went to the casino. He preythe online casinos now but since he didn't have another option  that's what he decided to do. 

I need a safe that he can't get into. A fingerprint one or something idk. I was thinking about a gun safe maybe? I feel like he would just find a way around that as well. When there's a will there's a way.

How to forget about the losses ?,"26(M) from Asia.

Currently jobless and lost almost half of my savings, living with my parents so I have very less expenses of my own as I don't go out much for movies , parties etc.

Recently botched 2 interviews and now this. I am unsure about telling the losses to my mother bcoz I had done this earlier this year and she asked me not to play again ever and forget about the losses. But I am an addict and stupid , I started again September, was up 40k then lost it along with more deposits within 2 days. 

I don't know how to tackle these thoughts of losses.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fyhgml/how_to_forget_about_the_losses/,3,3,1728332236.0

"Replaced blackjack with poker, predictable results","I have always loved NLHE poker and it's no coincidence I got back into poker during the beginning of blackjack taking a hold on me. I have been much better at not playing blackjack but replacing it with poker had several drawbacks. 

Because there is a significant amount of skill involved, I could convince myself that I was in control. Variance would lead to tilt and some risky plays paid off though statistically unsustainable. The second hidden cost was that I could play poker at a much higher volume. I can easily play poker for 10 hours a day on my phone, sitting on the couch all weekend only half engaged in the activities needed to survive as a human being. 

Well, I have dropped $3,000 of my $5,000 salary in one week playing mostly .6/1.20, .5/1 and some shot taking at 1/2. The longest I have gone without redepositing was three days, otherwise I am just getting stack and going on monkey tilt. I still think I am good at poker but at least now, my emotions can not handle tilt. 

It's been really tough. I have been away from my partner and poker has been all consuming. First thing I do when I wake up and play for an hour before work, then playing from basically 5pm until 1 or 2am with no break longer than a half hour before jumping back in. I am not sleeping well, my moods are dependent on my performance at the table, and I feel very little from the every day occurrences and offerings of life. It's disgusting and even worse, I have ruined poker as a game that I can play from time to time and enjoy. 

I self-excluded today. I dusted my last buy in and just felt totally numb, so disappointed that every day I tell myself I will take a break and within hours I am topping up for a re-buy.

If that wasn't enough, I re-downloaded an app that I am trying to self-exclude from (they offered a promo, then asking for my personal information) and punted off another $100 for good measure on blackjack. It's like maniacally self inflicted pain, some kind of masochistic manifestation of me not dealing with personal shit and stresses at work. 

So here I am guys. I looked at a GA meeting but unfortunately didn't see any online until the weekend. Let's see if I can get my head on straight and my life back on track.

12 Deceptive Lies Gambling Addiction Will Use to Keep You Hooked,"	1.	“Just one more time, and you’ll win it all back.”
The biggest lie of all. It convinces you that one more bet can undo all the losses and the pain. But deep down, you know that “one more time” only leads to another loss and more desperation.

	2.	“You’ve been good for a while; you deserve a break.”
Addiction makes you feel like you’ve earned the right to gamble again because you’ve managed to stay away for a while. But this so-called “break” is just an excuse to slip back into old patterns that you know will hurt you.

	3.	“You’re in control this time.”
It tells you that you’re different now, that this time you won’t go overboard. But once you place that first bet, it’s the addiction that’s in control—not you.

	4.	“You can afford to lose this much.”
This lie convinces you that because you have some money set aside, it’s okay to gamble. But it never stays “just a little,” and before you know it, you’re risking what you can’t afford to lose.

	5.	“Nobody has to know.”
It keeps you hiding your actions, isolating you from those who care about you. It tells you that you can keep it a secret, but secrecy only feeds the addiction, making it grow more powerful in the dark.

	6.	“This time, it’ll be different.”
This lie convinces you that the next time you gamble, things will turn out better. But the reality is that unless you stop completely, the outcome is always the same—loss, regret, and pain.

	7.	“You’ve already lost so much, what’s a little more?”
This lie preys on your hopelessness, making you feel like there’s no point in stopping now. It makes you believe that since you’re already in deep, you might as well go deeper. It stops you from seeing the value in quitting before things get even worse.

	8.	“You’re only hurting yourself.”
It makes you believe that your actions are only affecting you, but that’s not true. Your addiction impacts your family, your relationships, your career—everyone who cares about you. It uses this lie to keep you from asking for help.

	9.	“You’ll figure it out later.”
It pushes the consequences down the road, telling you that you’ll deal with the fallout some other time. But “later” never comes, and the mess just keeps piling up until it feels impossible to escape.

	10.	“You’re a failure anyway, so what does it matter?”
This lie attacks your self-worth, making you believe that you don’t deserve to get better. It tries to convince you that you’re not capable of change, so you might as well keep gambling.

	11.	“I didn’t lose as much as that person, so I might not be addicted.”
This is the lie of comparison. It tricks you into thinking that because someone else might have lost more, you’re somehow still in control. But addiction isn’t about how much you’ve lost—it’s about the grip it has on your mind. Whether you’ve lost $500 or $50,000, the fact that you can’t walk away is the real issue.

	12.	“Just one more bet. If I win back even a fraction of what I lost, I’ll quit.”
This lie gives you false hope. It makes you think that the next spin, the next hand, or the next game will be the one that sets everything right. But you know that even if you win, you’ll keep pushing, trying to get back more. And if you lose, you’re right back to chasing. It’s a cycle that keeps you trapped.

These lies are powerful, and they’re designed to keep you stuck in the vicious cycle of gambling. Recognizing them for what they are—deceptions that keep you trapped—can be the first step towards breaking free. You need to fight these lies with the truth: that you can regain control of your life, that you do deserve better, and that the only way to win is to stop playing entirely.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fyas8y/12_deceptive_lies_gambling_addiction_will_use_to/,30,4,1728315799.0

I want to play a game…,"
I was wondering if there are people here who have ever imagined being a victim of jigsaw.

I mean: we haven't had a bad life (relatively) and it still isn’t that bad. But we pretend life is unbearable without gambling. 

Moaning in thought how everything used to be better, while you put a few more coins in the slot machine, grumbling.

Not realizing that you're still doing the very thing you blame yourself for not having stopped!

How can you blame yourself for continuing to gamble for so long when you are still doing the very same thing.

There must come a time to break the chain.

That moment hasn’t come yet and will not come if you don't change something about your life.

Not just something…but everything!

Turn your whole life around.

Afraid to approach that one beautiful woman? Wouldn't you normally approach her? Do it this time!

Afraid to ask for a raise? Because you need your job anyway. Afraid of your boss's reaction. Do it this time!

Afraid to go to a party on your own? Do it this time!

Afraid and not in the mood to make new contacts. Have you convinced yourself that you don't need anyone? Do it this time.

You got nothing to lose. 

Gambling isn’t a way of living anymore.

So do what other (“normal”) people are doing (except heavy drinking obviously!😅).

Your life needs to be turned upside down!

Every aspect!

You talk about wanting to quit, but let’s be real—you’re not doing what it takes. A one- or two-year self-exclusion? That’s a joke. It’s just buying time until you’re back at it, feeding your addiction again. If you’re serious, self-exclude permanently. Slam the door shut forever. Hand over your finances, block every access point, and make damn sure you can’t gamble even if you’re dying to. Your next “done” will leave you in a far worse position—quit now, or be ready to lose everything.

sports betting,"After like couple of months of not wasting my energy in gambling, here we go again 

before 4 weeks i saw champions league games so i thought to myself to predict some games but not to place any money.

i got the bet right and i was so mad, so i thought to place some money the next day.

ended up to predict 7/8 matches which made me ever more mad.

since then, im trying to hit a win and i was 5,6 times so close to win 3,4,5k and be in profit.

Now im down 600$ which i understand is not alot compared to what some people lost here.

But i think its still a scary thing if i dont make it stop because in these 2 years im probably down 5k from gambling.

Its not only for the money but the energy and the passion that i lose for my life.

I will start withdrawing all of my money in order not to be able to bet online anymore because the urge and the hope that i will win is what i am stuggling the most.

Im not struggling that much from the addicton as much from the hope and belief that i can really make some money.

I wish i had more control over myself and be able to spend a planned amount of money every month like 50$ or 100$.

I send prayers to all of you people feeling bad, you are not alone and we are together in this.

It will be worse in the close future for all of us if we continue to gamble.

I've been doing it with passion and with analyzing so thats why i was really close to win most of the times but i didnt sadly.

I love football and i love betting on sports, but its ruining my energy and my life. 

I feel like these 4 weeks im not alive even tho im living.

I want to get back to my normal life where i dont think about gambling!

I found what triggers me when I start a session, i get h*gh and i made a habit that everytime i get high i get a random though to deposit x amount, i could make x10 the initial amount and won’t cashout, then i chase the ilusion that i will win more and in the end i lose a lot more. In the past six months i found myself in the Same loop and it’s draining me i swear to god, i keep trying and trying and in this moment I want to start day without gambling. I understand what triggers me and i try to keep away for hard dr*gs.

The movie nailed the reality of how predatory these platforms are, how they keep you hooked, and how destructive it becomes—not just financially, but emotionally and socially. It was tough to watch, especially knowing so many are stuck in that exact trap.

I relapsed yesterday after 645 days clean. Aftermath,"After 645 days totally clean, I relapsed yesterday. It was a hard relapse that contained everything.

Firstly I visited a local betting shop and put 50 EUR on 4-5 matches. All lost later in the day.

When I went home, I opened a new account on a betting website and deposited 500 EUR. There was a deposit bonus of 500 EUR that needed a total wager of 5000 in order to be withdrawable. I registered on 4 poker tournaments 3 for 50 with 1 rebuy and one of 100. Totally bought 300 EUR, cashed out 72 and advanced on Day 2 today on the big one of 100.

With the remaining cash I put some more bets on soccer and played the Gates of Olympus slot. Out of nowhere the slot paid me 600 on 0.50 spins. Then I opened some more windows and played some roulette and slots alltogether, while there were soccer bets running all the night. At some point I was up to 2200 EUR in balance plus some open bets and the 100 tournament, so it was somewhere around 2500 or a bit more. I drunk some whiskey and increased the bets a bit. This is where things turned bad and roulette fucked me hard while the slot got cold too. I slowly saw my balance going down, some bets won and got a bit up but eventually the cold on everything dominated and led my balance to 0. I deposited another 280 EUR lost it fast and tried to do a big deposit of more that 1000 with a card that I have never used for gambling in the past. My card was blocked and also my web banking was blocked too due to security reasons. I stopped there because anyway the website has a rule of maximum deposits of 800 for new accounts until the KYC process finishes that I noticed later. Otherwise I would possibly still gamble and lose more.

It was a real roller coaster coming from old times. Multiple games at the same time, sports-betting, poker tournaments, casino games, all in one night. Went up for good, then down. Also drunk a bit and finally fucked one of my bank cards and accounts, risking more of my total bank balance.

I lost 830 EUR in 13.5 hours that the roller coaster lasted. This is an amount that will not hurt me financially if I don't do it again. My financials in the last 2 years that I stayed clean and also the dincipline that I showed the years before that, even with some relapses here and there, have increased for a good 6-digits amount, so this loss was less than 0.5% of what my sobriety brought me.

Will I do it again? No, I will play the remaining Day 2 of the tournament and will start counting my days again by tomorrow.

Do I feel regrets? No, this was actually something that I wanted to do. Staying clean for so much time has made me very strong and this was a decision that I took with 100% responsibility. Why I did this is another chapter that will take much time to expain. But if I turned back time to yesterday 16:00 when I put my first bet, I would do it again. But only for yesterday. If I keep gambling for the next days, this will be a totally different discussion and definitely a huge-huge-huge mistake on my side.

Do I feel ashamed that I risked more of my money? Yes and No. Yes because it showed me how powerfull a roller coaster is that makes you take decisions and do actions that look extremelly stupid for the common sense and that you can lose control very fast, even in some hours after years of sobriety. No because I deserved some small relapse, some ""entertainment"", after staying clean for too long.

What I hate most is that with the failed card deposit that led to freeze of my card and web-banking, I need to explain to people on the phone how this happened out of nowhere. And I am going to look for a mortgage in next weeks/months and this could somehow affect my financial image and evaluation.

10 days ago I put 9K in the stock market, so there was some gambling emotions of up-down, lose-win, etc all the previous days before the relapse. My last relapse 2 years ago also begun with an investement on stocks that turned into a 2 month crazy roller-coaster. This time will be different, I know it and I feel it. I will keep you posted in the next days.

One thing that is very important to mention is that self-exlusion is a blessing for us gamblers. I have self exluded for lifetime from the biggest and best gambling websites of my country (including bet365 which offers the best betting experience by far, and pokerstars which offers also top experience on poker). Being unable to gamble on these websites, makes the whole thing less attractive. If I also self exlude from this new website, which is couple of clicks away, this will make the total gambling experience less attractive. I am actually 4-5 of self-exclusions away from leaving myself able to gamble only on shadding websites, which is totally disgusting to me.

Also, one thing worth to mention is that I visited the local betting shop as an action to increase my social life a bit. Such shops are everywhere in my town and going back to them, fill my day with lots of human reactions, small talk, and take me away from my home isolation and screen watching. Of course after the first couple of hours in the betting shop, I returned again to my home isolation and screen watching, loosing more of my money and watching figures going up and down :) But this is how us gamblers function isn't it?

Sorry for the long post, I will stay committed to the sub for the next days, keep strong guys, this is a long term battle that everyone of us has to give",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fy46do/i_relapsed_yesterday_after_645_days_clean/,39,23,1728295957.0
702 days gratefully without a bet,"Today:  
·       I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

·       I am grateful that I am alive and experiencing right now.

·       I am grateful to feel compassion for everyone who has suffered in the world since the October 7^(th) attacks last year.

·       I am grateful to see deep down that holding onto and clinging to views and opinions is the root of all this suffering.

·       I am grateful to accept that views and opinions come and go, they change on a whim and for all sorts of reasons having nothing to do with me. That’s just the way they are. Identifying with them and believing that they are an inherent part of me, the subject observing, instead of what they really are, observable energy that I can see and feel inside, is delusion and in my experience just leads to more suffering.

·       I am grateful to see that this doesn’t just apply to politics. It also applies to views and opinions about me and/or the body I’m in, whether they come from inside or from others.

·       I am grateful that I’m not getting caught up in the political madness of the moment.

·       I am grateful to see through the false choice my mind thinks it’s being forced to make. It is possible to care about the world, make choices to benefit the world, and be a light that shines and inspires without needing to identify with one political candidate or another to do so.

·       I am grateful for the opportunities today to accept who I am, the Universe I live in, and the way things are.

It took everything from me,"When I was a compulsive gambler trading stocks, it wasn’t just my money that I lost—it slowly took over every part of my life. I stopped listening to my favorite music, the songs that used to lift me up or calm me down no longer mattered because all I could think about was the next trade. I stopped buying clothes, didn’t even bother fixing my beard or taking care of myself like I used to. Hygiene? It slipped away. I didn’t care how I dressed; what was the point when my mind was somewhere else, buried in numbers, charts, and the desperate hope that the next win would fix everything?

It took everything from me—my time, my energy, my relationships, my sense of self. Every waking moment was consumed by the rush of trading, by the highs and devastating lows, until there was nothing left but the wreckage of who I used to be. Even the smallest things I once enjoyed felt pointless. It didn’t happen overnight; it was a slow, insidious process that I didn’t even notice at first, until one day I looked in the mirror and didn’t recognize myself.

The addiction didn’t just strip away my money—it took my identity, my passions, and left me feeling hollow.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fxrs6b/it_took_everything_from_me/,18,5,1728251103.0

We are survivors,"Each and every one of us, who’s here is a survivor

We survived our gambling addiction.

We are doing the best we can to not fall in its hands again.

Cause in the end, there’s only one outcome;

**SUICIDE**

When you have nothing left, not even your sanity, then what’s left to live for?

Gambling takes it all.

There’s no win big enough that will make you stop and walk away forever.

The dopamine fades away and you will come back for another dosis.

It’s the ultimate drug. 

Easy accessible, not harming your body directly, and not visible.

Last Lifeline,"
First time here forgive my grammar.Long post

I think I got into gambling when I lost interest on things that used to give me the most joy. When I was 13 I got into watching stuffs. I got hooked on anime,kdrama and american tc series. Back then I got so into the thing I'm watching that I imagine myself as a character involve with my pick favorite character. I used to sleep imagining scenarios in my head. 

During my college days this stop. I no longer enjoy watching and I stop finding joy in most stuff even the social medias. Because of lack of thrill in anything I found gambling.

It started November 2023 after we visited my father's grave, I cash in on a online casino. Php 500 ez its a small money. I won 2000. The next day I didnt play but when the Christmas came and i was alone in the house I got board again and  deposited my whole christmas money. 3000 played throughout the 24th and 25th of December.

Turns out something is fun to do again. Before I know it I am already addicted. I graduated july 2023. I was preparing for my boards but stop January 2024 because I cannot stop playing. Everyday I get money I load it in. 

I thought I am controlling myself turns out I already lose the sane part of me. 

Fastforward by September 2024 I got my bday money, A gift by my mother. The moment she gave it to me I deposited 1/5 of the money. Within 15 mins I lost it all. I kept doing this until I lose it all. In the fear of my mother finding out that I lost all the money, I turned into a bigger problem. Loaning at loan apps. It started small amount just 2,000. I kept thinking I should recover my bday money and enough cash to pay may loan. I dont know what happened next until I lost one midnight and computed my loans that I already have 80k into my name. I cried how could I be so stupid. I keep hurting myself because my life is destroyed because I couldnt control myself. 

I bang my head into the wall and that is when I realize I need help. This is why Im here. I need to lessen this heaviness in my chest before I confess to my family and ask for their forgiveness and help. 

I had such a good dream about my future. My 17 years old self wanted my now 25 years old self to live abroad and earn a house for my mom but now I plan to give her more pain by confessing. 

I have no Idea how to start anything rn as I dont have a job. The loans I have keeps me awake 24/7. I plan on selling my ewallet but I recently found out that thats illegal to do. 

I wish I could turn back to Nov 2023 and slap myself. The college me was so organize and smart that I miss so much.

I wish gambling here in the ph is illegal. I keep seeing fb influencers posting and advertising gambling as a means of earning money (this is how i got informed) and its not!! Once you get into it, there is no way out. 

I need your best wishes reddit I am taking my first step into stopping gambling tomorrow.

Day 1252 - A look back/always looking forward to the next day,"Hi All,

I have not been on here in a while, but looked back through my posts and combined them for a refresh for anyone it might help even in the slightest - everything still holds true.

The path has not been easy and it’s an every day mindset, in the end I know I’ve changed my life and that is what counts.

One minute, one hour, one day at a time.

Sports gambling was at the core of my problem. 

Things that have worked for me that may work for you. 

1. Open up to family and friends. Be Honest, don’t hold anything back. 

2. Create personal accountability - be accountable to yourself, family and friends. Be accountable to others you are going along this road to recovery with.

3. Play the Tape to the End / Remember the Tough Emotions - before placing any bet, go through the entire story - here’s the spoiler….YOU LOSE. How does that make you feel? Use that feeling to motivate you to not bet and WIN (by not betting and keeping your $$$)

4. Seek Group Help / Use Available resources - GA or other support groups are amazing. It really helps you connect and understand that you are not alone.

5. Ban yourself permanently from any sites, casinos etc. 

6. Listening to the Gambling Still Sucks podcast

Opening up to people who were close to me. My mom and my GF were the first people I told.
- I thought my GF was going to leave me
- I thought my mom would fall into a state of depression. This is what held me back for years. Gambling addiction has been in our family.

**It is very very important to come with a plan to show you are going to put yourself on a more positive path 

Opening up to friends
- Gambling were the main talking points in a lot of my friends groups. When I abstained from gambling I told them what I needed from them and that was to remove me from any gambling talk. 

Remove yourself from high risk situations 

BAN YOURSELF FOR LIFE - not for 1 year, not for 3 years…FOR LIFE from any gambling websites

MONEY IS RELATIVE TO EACH INDIVIDUAL 

A group member reached out to me which prompted this. After making a comment about the comparisons around total money lost not being an essential part to recovery I figured I’d share and hopefully help others with my thoughts.

I completely understand that people share dollar figures to help identify the severity of the situation, but it should never be used to compare why one situation is worse or better than another. We are definitely not in any competition to 1-up someone with a worse story. 

Money is relative to each individual and the situation they are in. Someone can lose $5,$500 or $500K and the emotional and mental effect may be the exact same thing. 

We are here to help each other on this journey of recover. We should be sharing advice and strategies not saying why one situation is worse than another. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fxi3rb/day_1252_a_look_backalways_looking_forward_to_the/,6,4,1728225963.0

God knows how angry I am with myself for not being able to give because I put myself in this situation because of gambling.

The only thing I can do to meet their demands is to completely disregard everything for myself. But even then, it's still not enough.

Fear when thinking about gambling,"Hello everyone,

Need to keep myself updated so I'll do some post tracking my progress, It's been a while since I'm trying to quit, and today is day 4, but something feels different. 

Two days ago I smoked some weed as I regulary do, weed is an addiction I strangely control easily (It scare me to see how well I can control this one but not gambling at all). 
Anyway, as I was high, I went into a big introspection session. Thinking about my life, and especially about my gambling addiction. 
And then, it kind of clicked, it's like I could see and understand everything, why it's happening, how it tricked me, how the best time to quit is NOW. 

And yeah, since that, when I got any urge or when I just think about gambling, I'm also filled with what seems to be fear ? Or Terror ? 

To me it feel like a great thing ? It's kinda strange but I'm conforted by the idea of fearing that damn addiction

Lost every single paycheck between 18 to 28 years of age (over 300 000 USD).,"Gotta share my gambling story somewhere, figured i'd post here.

My first ever bet was the day I turned 18 and got a savings account worth 10k from my father, ended up winning 4k my first ever bet, feeling like a champion. My first week I was gambling with those 4k winnings and by the end of the week I was up double my money.

I remember feeling like I was special, I'm not going to lose this money, how could I when I just managed to double my money in a week. As most people might have guessed, the following week, I lost my profit in a matter of one hour. Started with a big bet on roulette which I lost into chasing my losses (Which was actually my winnings). 

Fastfoward a few months and all the money from my savings account was gone, losing abit every week. I am very lucky being born into a upper-middle class family with enough means to support me without issue even when I was past 18 years old, but I do believe this was also a big reason for the continueation of my addiction. 

I remember the first couple of years from 18 - 23, every single month I deposited my paycheck only keeping enough to make it seem as if I was okay for the people around me. Because I was still living with my parents and having most food and other expenses paid by them I though that every paycheck I put into the casino was a small chance for me to break even and feel like I didin't have to be a burden for my family or have the freedom to get my own place too live or enjoy my life with my own money.

I could never accept that my paycheck was only X amount of money when I was down so much from gambling. I always wanted more. Some months I could win big, but by the end of the month I had always lost it all, no matter how big I was up. I never went out anywhere, never traveled, just stayed at home and went to work. I never had any means to do otherwise.

When I turned 24 I told my father about my problems, he always knew I had issues gambling, but he never though it was this bad. After this I managed to stay clean for about a year, the money I had saved up I used to travel with my friends and truly enjoy life. I felt like I was finally free, not thinking about all the time and money wasted in the past.

But after my traveling and using most of my money saved up actually enjoying life, I was thinking. What if I put the rest of my money in the casino, I don't care about winning back my previous losses, but If i win back the money i've spent traveling I can do it again for free. Ofcourse I lost whatever money I had left and was back to my previous ways of chasing my losses, just up until I was back to what I had before traveling.

Between 25 and 27 I lost every single paycheck again, feeling despair and many sleepless nights thinking what a loser I am, still living at home, no money saved and no motivation of working as I know that all my effort will be put into the casinos hands.

When I turned 27 I decided that I was going to make a big change and hope that It would be enough to keep me away from gambling. I was making enough money online working in my home country to live comfortably in Asia as long as I did not gamble any of it away. I would not be able to save any money, but that was okay for me as I needed to start with freeing myself from gambling.

I went on a online dating app before going to Asia, started a relationship with a girl in Vietnam, and later started my new life there with her. The first two months was great, no gambling, just enjoying life with my new partner in a new country with new culture. Getting into month three, she started asking me about expensive roadtrips, traveling together to new countries and things I simply could not afford with my strapped budget.

We were living very comfortably with the money I was making, but that little bit of extra pleasure was just out of reach for me. And you guessed it, I decided that in order to give her everything she wanted, I was going to gamble my way there. By my 4th month in Vietnam I had for the first time in my life, put myself in debt. I now had no money and was 2 months of salary in debt. So I had to go back home to my parents again and leave my life in Asia.

First month back home I put my next paycheck into the casino hoping I could win back my debt and lost it straight away.

Moving foward to now, I am 28 years old. Still 1 paycheck in debt and continueing to gamble away every single paycheck I have in hopes of just making some money. I know I can never make back my losses or even keep my winnings if I were to win something, I always end up losing everything I have but I cannot stop and I don't see any way out of my despair. My brain is just wired to shit, and I cannot stop myself from doing it even though I know how it's gonna end.

  
Sorry if I broke any guidelines for the forum, just wanted to share my story.

I am grateful for all that’s been given and to everyone who has given.

Withdrawal symptoms from Setraline got worse overnight, especially combined with what feels like an incoming cold; but they presented me experiences to learn from, especially how to be patient and compassionate toward myself and what my body is going through right now. 

I am grateful that I’m giving my body attention and caring instead of getting lost in self destructive thinking and doing,

I am grateful for growing acceptance of the unknown future, the reality of the past that no longer exists except as biased memories and thoughts, and the way that it all is, now how I want it to be.

I am grateful to see through yesterdays experiences that sometimes it’s better to bite my tongue instead of lash out from clinging to and defending this concept of myself I’ve created since childhood.

Day 0 and needing to quit for good,"Started online gambling in January and it's been a spiral of emotional, mental, physical, social, and monetary loss. I've tried to quit multiple times since then, but it only lasts hours, days, or weeks. Never been more than a month. I've blocked myself from websites, got out of gambling discords, went to see a gambling psychologist, but my brain/I always find a way around it by rationalizing it or trying to take the easy route - whether it's finding more sites, creating alt accounts, or waiting just long enough to think I'm ready to do it sensibly. Time and time again, I disappoint myself only until the next time.



I'm 29M and I'm absolutely disgusted with myself - I feel like an utter failure and shell of my former self - I've wasted so much time sitting on my computer gambling instead of focusing on my career, on my hobbies, and being generally creative and curious. I'd have 20k saved if it wasn't for this addiction but at this very moment I only have 1.2k. I've hit 0 in savings about 3 times this year. I live with my parents still and I think that's also the reason why I'm willing to gamble practically everything away because I know I won't be homeless or starving. Told myself last year that I'd move out by end of this year or start of the next if I could make enough of an income and savings so I could have some real financial responsibilities and move my life forward. 



On the bright side, I am not in debt or have a family to support. The only damage I've done is to my own bank account, my social circle, my self-esteem, my hobbies, and my career. I know that all that is recoverable if I were to resume a life without gambling.



I'm writing this post now since even though I think all this, I have already have thoughts of ""quitting"", but coming back with even more money to play with - like I'm fantasizing saving up 20k to try and double it. It's an endless cycle and I'm so tired of feeling like this, but I know every time the feeling goes away or I try to remember it, it's superseded by the desire to win.



The only real way to recover now is to quit, period. I've been told this and told myself too many times, but I never stay true to it, or at least have yet to.

  
So starting today, as of this post, I declare to myself that I quit gambling. No more visiting the sites or watching videos. I'm banning myself from all of them and blocking all the channels. I accept that the money is gone. There are no losses to recover and money to be won. It's time to start again. There is even more money to be made and used to create a fulfilling life.

  
I hope this is truly the start. If you have any advice, perspectives, or thoughts, please feel free.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fxdv4o/day_0_and_needing_to_quit_for_good/,2,5,1728212042.0

Day 298: I will happily take the L in gambling in order to earn the W in life,"Lose the battle and win the war my friends. There is nothing that I regret more and would love to change more than making that first bet. 

Nothing has caused me more heartache, desperation and misery. Bringing me to my lowest of lows. Never contemplating suicide but understanding suicide and that is scary enough! 

Gambling has been my biggest stumbling block to self actualization, self awareness and inner peace. 

If you can admit the same, do we want to remove the stumbling block or continue to trip and fall? 

Success in life is hard enough. Working, saving and grinding. Overcoming unexpected bills, inflation, lay offs. We don't need to make it more challenging with gambling. 

I have every confidence in the fact that the true you......the hard working, motivated, self aware you.....that accepts defeat in gambling in order to achieve success in life will do just that!

Remembering that I questioned being alive after my last series of losses as well as my girlfriend telling me not to go back to that place (the casino) kept me away.

I almost relapsed today but I was able to stay away.

Diagnosed with ADHD,"I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, and it feels like everything about my past is finally coming into focus. For years, I struggled with a compulsive need to trade, constantly chasing the next big win. What I thought was just poor decision-making now makes sense—it was the impulsivity, the hyperfocus, the way ADHD drives you to chase that dopamine hit.

Trading was more than just a financial game; it was an obsession. The highs and lows of the market fed directly into my ADHD tendencies. I’d get lost for hours, impulsively making decisions without thinking through the consequences. And when I lost? I’d double down, driven by an irrational need to recoup my losses. It wasn’t just about the money; it was about the thrill, the rush, and the relentless drive to keep going, no matter the cost.

Now, with this diagnosis, I can finally see how my ADHD wasn’t just a background issue—it was fueling my addiction, pushing me to make reckless decisions, and trapping me in a cycle I couldn’t break. But knowing this now gives me hope. I can finally start to untangle the connection between my ADHD and the addiction, and work towards real change.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fwzphd/diagnosed_with_adhd/,8,4,1728160514.0

Addicted to the social aspect of casinos?,"I started this in July and I’m probably down $20-25k now. Have blown through $7500 of “free” grant money and an $8000 student loan in the last month. Today I had to apply for my first payday personal loan because I failed to pay rent before draining my account to $98 last night.


A paradox I’ve realized is that escaping into the allure of the casino and the “social life” - spending hours there drinking and flirting and chatting and laugh - is the only time I feel “okay” and stop ruminating on the destruction stated above. Multiple men (patrons and pit bosses) wanting to take me on lavish dates or pursue me (attention I’ve never gotten before), a sense of belonging with the other regulars, excitement & good conversation with my favorite dealers, VIP handshakes from the table games manager when I arrive. I feel important there. Special. Wanted. Though I know what the whole machine REALLY wants from me is my money, the casino is filling some relational voids I’ve been carrying for a long time. 

Typing it out makes me realize how stupid it is but I’m scared of how much more depressed I’ll be if I lose the “good” parts of going there and am just left with the ruin. Even now, I’m fighting urges not to hurt myself on a daily basis. 
In a weird way I’m hanging on to the social part in a feeble attempt to “balance” things out and delude myself into thinking going there is worth it.

My Gambling Problem,"For the last eight years or so, I’ve been heavily involved in a 12 step fellowship for stopping drugs (opiates etc.) and alcohol. It has been an incredible journey and obsession to drink and do drugs has been gone for quite some time. I stopped at 19 years old after going through a treatment center and then getting involved with a 12 step fellowship. I am 28 years old now. I’ve had the privilege of helping a lot of people, and have a lot of good mentors.

With that said, over the first few years of sobriety from substance abuse, I hopped into a casino here and there a few times. Anytime I lost it was no fun, and I found myself easily able to not return for long stretches of time. I found table games like blackjack and roulette to be a lot of fun. I remember going with family and trying a few clicks of a slot machine, and it seemed ridiculous to me that people could overdo it, let alone play them to begin with. One memory I have is that there was an addictive nature to it for me, even in the beginning. While I was in the casino, I would chase. Go back to the ATM, and do reckless bets trying to recover losses. For example, after losing a few hundred dollars at blackjack or roulette, I would go to the ATM, pull a few hundred more out, and put it all on one bet to try to win it back. Still, once I left, I felt pretty sick about losing and could easily not go back for a while. 

That brings me to this year. I started to find ALOT of enjoyment in slot machines. I won a few handpays, but overall every time I play them, it has been a roller coaster of mostly losing money. Something has changed though. I have started feeling compelled to go back to the casino. There have been multiple times now, where I go in with a few hundred dollars, start playing slots, and all discipline goes out the window. I start betting higher (25-100 dollars per spin), and before I know it, I am hitting my daily withdrawal limit (which I raised from $1,000 to $2,000 a couple of months ago while chasing a loss) and I’m walking out of the casino down $2,000 feeling absolutely sick. I’m probably down 10K+ from gambling this year if I had to guess. 

Lately I’ve been thinking about slot machines, more and more, and this week, I have been fantasizing about going and playing. It is a craving. When I play, I notice I literally feel the dopamine rush. I feel an “in the zone” or “cracked out hyperfocus” sort of feeling. 

I also learned something else over the last few years. After some deep conversations with my father, I found out that this highly intelligent man I looked at as a superhero has had a serious kryptonite in his life: Casinos and slot machines. I found out he even had long stints of sobriety in gamblers anonymous. This is a man who should be retired right now, but cannot as he has likely gambled millions over his lifetime. Earlier this year, I was with him during a relapse. He asked me to go to a casino with him when he came to visit, And he degenerate gambled on slot machines for a total of probably 24 hours in a three day weekend. It was bad. Shortly after, he told me about the profound impact that gambling addiction has had on him over his life. I heard some pretty incredibly bad stories. The Reason I even bring this up is to say I can see the damage it caused him over his life, and I know that I am very likely similar to him. I see the pull and allure of gambling, and like I said, have been fantasizing about slot machines all week. 


My plan is to go later and ban myself from the hard rock casino. A lifetime self exclusion. I do know there are some other casinos in the area (south Florida) but I have never been to them. Maybe I ought to go into as many as I can and self exclude. Regardless, I am going to do it at the place I have always went to gamble, the hard rock. I think I am probably not above going into debt and ruining my life from gambling, and figure I need to get serious. The pull and obsession to gamble and play slots has felt progressively stronger. But with that said, I’m also thinking about playing one last time when I go to ban myself. With drugs and alcohol, the one last time mentality Is typically a lie and very destructive. I have been loitering and reading posts from this group for a few weeks, and wanted to share and contribute.

700 days gratefully without a bet,"Today:  
·       I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

·       I am grateful for the meditative practice of calming mind.

·       I am grateful to see how suffering inside starts with ignorance and denial of the way things are.

·       I am grateful to admit my emotionally complex relationship with food. It has been a daily struggle to stay mindful and not cling to mind when it descends into harshly judgmental thoughts, especially when triggered by interactions physically and mentally with food.  

·       I am grateful to see how conditioned thoughts are from the way body feels and emotions inside, and how powerful these thoughts are from historical repetition and pattern.

·       I am grateful to experience the symptoms of withdrawal from not taking anti-depressants. I’ve been tapering off, and yesterday was the first day that I didn’t take any. I can see how they’ve been influencing mind and body, and it puts all that I’ve experienced recently into proper context.  

·       I am grateful for spiritual traditions and practices that guide me on this path and give me faith and confidence in where its heading without knowing it firsthand.

·       I am grateful for daily gratitude practice. Sometimes it feels like I have nothing to say, or that voice inside tells me that no one is listening so why bother, and I learn from whatever’s going on inside. Doing this helps me stay accountable and remember how things really are, even when mind and ego tell me otherwise.

·       I am grateful that this is what I’m dealing with now, not the self-destruction that would happen if I ever went back and gamble again. I don’t want that life anymore.

Just one last bet ,"This is how gambling addiction works. Let’s say you’re down $50k, and it hurts like hell. You tell yourself, “If I can just make back $10k, I’ll stop for good.” Maybe you do make that $10k back, and for a moment, you feel relief. But then reality hits—you’re still $40k down. Now, the stakes feel even higher. So, you think, “Just $20k more, and I’ll be okay.”

But that $10k you just won? It disappears in no time, and now you’re back to zero. You’ve drained all your cash. Desperation sets in, and you start reaching for credit cards, borrowing money, or taking out loans. Before you know it, your $50k loss has ballooned to $100k.

This is the trap: it never ends. No matter how deep you are in, gambling will only make things worse. The only way to truly win is to stop now, before it destroys everything.

We don’t really want the money. We don’t even need it.

Life is richer when we focus on simple living instead of the luxuries we once dreamed of.

We’re still chasing the ambitions we formed at age 17-21, unable to let them go.

Obsessed.

It’s time to let go.

Forget the money. Forget the dreams you clung to as a teenager.

Life is about hard work, gratitude, appreciation, and love.

We’ve neglected the true essence of life.

For far too long.

We need to relearn how to live life.

Gambling is not life.

One baby step at a time.

Each step brings us closer to what we fear most: death.

Life is difficult.

But we must accept it on its terms and conditions.

A Call for Change in the Online Gambling Industry,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my story with you all in hopes of sparking a conversation about an issue that affects many of us: gambling addiction. I've been struggling with this disease since I was a teenager, and now at 32, I’ve hit rock bottom more times than I can count. It’s hard to express the pain and despair that comes with it, especially in a world where online gambling is just a few taps away on our phones.

Ludopathy is considered a disease, and while we are responsible for our actions, it often feels like the system is set up to make things worse rather than better. The ease of access to online casinos and sports betting can lead to severe financial loss, and for many of us, it feels like the odds are stacked against us. It’s disheartening to see that every year, these casinos are making more and more money, often at the expense of those who are struggling with our disease.

Many of these gambling websites are designed to create addiction, targeting those who might not yet have a problem, and for those of us who do, they are crafted to keep us trapped. The design elements encourage continuous play and make it incredibly difficult to stop, effectively exploiting our vulnerabilities.

We must hold these casinos accountable for their actions. They should take responsibility for the harm they cause and provide compensation to those of us who have gone into debt, lost our families, and even contemplated taking our own lives due to the relentless cycle of addiction they perpetuate.

I know this is a hard path to follow, but I believe it’s time we come together to advocate for real change in the online gambling industry. We need stronger regulations to protect vulnerable individuals like ourselves. Here are a few ideas I’ve been thinking about:

1. **Stricter Safety Measures**: Online casinos should implement rigorous steps to help protect users, such as self-exclusion options, deposit limits, and clear communication about the risks of gambling.
2. **Accountability for Casinos**: We need to hold these companies accountable for their role in perpetuating gambling addiction. They are aware of the consequences and yet continue to profit from our struggles without any regard for our well-being.
3. **Legal Support and Community Action**: I’ve talked with some lawyers, and if we unite as a community, we can push for compensation for the harm caused—both financially and morally.

I know this is a challenging journey, but I’m sharing my thoughts here because I believe that maybe, just maybe, something can be done. If any of you are interested in organizing or have thoughts on how we can advocate for these changes, please comment below. Let’s work towards creating a safer environment for ourselves and future generations.

Thanks for reading, and let’s support each other on this journey.

Here's how much your life expect to have left.,"I have monthly payday, if I stop betting now, with life expectancy I think I'll work for. Even with lowest minimum third world country wage... (assuming steady rate, literally no promotion)
I'll have 209,500$

That is if I stop now. The number will keep going down if I don't stop, you are literally betting against your future self.

So you should stop now even if you don't have anyone else, you have your future self, think it like this: everytime you bet, your future self is getting hurt physically and mentally, and he send that feeling right back at you so that you stop.



For those who don't have much time left.... You probably have more wisdom than me anyway.

Told my gf about my gambling addiction - good ending,"I had a very long and emotional talk with my gf about my gambling addiction a while ago. I lost all of my paycheck when I relapsed yesterday and it really fcked up my brain and drained me mentally. Even though I knew that I worked hard for it, I still gambled like a madman and lost everything within an hour by chasing my losses.

But honestly, I never thought that she'd still accept me despite what happened. She told me that we'll be okay and that we can solve my problems together. It took me 2 years to tell someone about my addiction and I think I'm finally free. I self-excluded from every online casino that I play and from now on, she'll handle all my finances so she can monitor my spending habits and ensure that I don't relapse ever again. I can still feel the urges and I know it will be a very hard journey, but telling everything to my gf made me feel better.

To everyone that is suffering, please remember that you are not alone. I know how hard it is to muster up the courage to tell someone about this stupid crippling addiction, but sometimes, it's for the better that someone knows so they can offer help and support for you to become better.

Thesis project - How gambling affects the lives of teenagers,"I have received approval from the moderator to submit this post.

I’m studying a master's program, and as part of my thesis project, I’m researching how gambling affects the lives of teenagers. My aim through this research is to listen and learn so that I can create a short film on the topic as ethically as possible.

I’m looking for teenagers with gambling experience or adults who started gambling during their teenage years and would like to have a conversation with me. I understand that this is a sensitive topic, which can be difficult to discuss. Everything I collect will be confidential, and I won’t share any details about any individuals with others.

I'm open to having conversations anonymously through direct messages if anyone is willing to engage in a discussion. Again, I do understand that this is a sensitive topic, if I do ask a question that you're not comfortable answering, that's more than ok. 

It's important to me and for the project that this is as honest as possible. I don't want to create a fictional story based on my ideas about how people have been affected by their gambling or from what I’ve read in other research.

I’ve been in contact with several people but want to include more perspectives and experiences. The film will be inspired by, but not solely based on these experiences. To make it as ethical as possible, I aim to combine different situations from various individuals, situate my actors in these scenarios, and have them improvise the scenes. That way, the actors will be able to use their perspectives and knowledge to enhance the scenes, and we won’t just be doing a reconstruction of one individual’s experiences.

My question is - is there a specific situation in your daily life - a dinner, a birthday, or something at school, that was affected by gambling? For example, did it lead to stealing or change the dynamics of a ""usual"" situation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fw0gxe/thesis_project_how_gambling_affects_the_lives_of/,1,0,1728052038.0

Approaching 2 years free of the nightmare.,"I think there is something I can add to this space.  I failed to realize just how much of a lifestyle change ""no betting/gambling"" has to be.

I will have to return to work at some point but for now, I am just trying to figure out how to live without gambling.  I feel 618 days is a long time, but seriously, if you think you will just snap back after a year, news flash, that is probably too soon to expect major results, especially in my case, as I have been a gambler all my adult life.  Feels so stupid saying that, but time goes by so fast, I am already old.  I just thought I'd be a gambler forever.  Changing into someone else has been so hard to do.  I have said it before, gambling takes more than money, it takes time along with it.  If you continue to gamble, your life gets progressively worse.  I just want everyone to be realistic in their quest. You have to make ""not gambling/betting"" a lifestyle and wait a long time to heal.  A real long time.

Finally told my parents ,"Context: 21 year old male in UK. 2k pm salary, 1k pm rent in London. Around £11k debt from my habitual compulsive gambling. 

I never thought I’d be in the position I’m in now (how original). I always thought and knew gambling was the devil and looked at others that did as foolish. This guilt, and consequently hiding my gambling from family is probably what has caused it to spiral so far out of control. 

What first started as occasional betting on football with mates turned into online casinos and they quickly grabbed me by the balls after winning a bit, and then losing it.. and more. Over the past 3 years it just got worse and worse, and chasing losses turned to taking on debt to chase more, and repeat. Interest free overdrafts.. ah I don’t have to pay now I’ll just win it back then stop… no.

I self excluded myself about 2 years, and about 9 grand of debt, ago this is not a solution to the poison that is gambling. There’s been times I’ve won, massively, over 10k multiple times that would have cleared my debt and more and then lost it all, and more. Iv literally withdrawn enough money to ‘solve’ everything multiple times and then cancelled it before processed and lost it all. It’s just insane and I now know there’s no point even thinking about That, the winnings were never mine, I was falling right into their trap and I’m a fool for it. 

Over the past few months it’s got to the point where I’ve been ridiculously reckless and have cost myself years of time, wrecked relationships and my closest family friends a huge burden and I’m done. Most recently I gambled my whole paycheck in 1 night, rent money included and left nothing for the month to live. I completely broke down and told my parents which I’m both relieved and so thankful/lucky to have them because I known I can sort this out now, but also so ashamed to burden them with this horrible habit that is completely my fault and I feel like I don’t deserve the help. 

I’m making a plan to get rid of all the debt with my dad, I have deleted all accounts, deleted email addresses that were getting spammed with devil promo and have fully accepted my situation and can say I won’t ever do this again it has made me a shell of the man I can be and I’m just so so done with it. 
But…

Please anyone that has been through this, known someone who has or just has knowledge on the matter please tell me anything that I should do to ensure this doesn’t happen again because I have been here before and then been right back in the same situation a few days/weeks/months later. I have downloaded apps that block me from using phone at certain times, am listening to audiobooks that are about building structure, discipline, emphasise importance of routine and have started implementing small changes to improve my habits. I already go to the gym regularly and am minimising drinking as this has cause me to slip in the past. But I’m just scared because I know what i have been capable of and if this happens again, well it just CANT happen again.

Break the cycle!,"
It’s day 431 for me today!  You have to break the cycle in order for you to heal from this disease.  Lifetime self exclusion saved my life.  I self-excluded TWICE for one year each time and went back thinking I could gamble like a “regular” person.  Truth is once you cross the line into “compulsive” or “problem” gambling, you’ll never be able to gamble again without reaching rock bottom or close to it.  Sure you’ll have winning streaks but you’ll end up losing even more after those streaks are over.

Aren’t you tired of working hard AF and losing all your money at the casino?  Aren’t you tired of feeling so low because you keep falling into the same trap over and over again? 

Sure, you’ll feel the effects of “withdrawal” for around 90 days, but that was way easier than any L I ever took!  If you need help breaking the cycle, reach out to me.

"I am new gambler, and aware I am becoming an addict.","Oh boy......

I was never a fan of gambling that includes scratch offs. Yet, in the beginning of July, this year, I joined a crypto casino. My starting deposit was $20, here and there. I was fine with a deposit of $20, it was fun (coming out of my paycheck). However, the amount of deposit started to increase to a max of $1000 (started taking money out from my savings).  My savings account wasn't anything spectacular, $7000. My savings of $7000 turned into $3000. Maybe for some it is not much, but for me it was my blood sweat and tears. I actually cried seeing my savings at $3000.

Crying over the loss, didn't stop me. I chased after it. I deposit $200, got super lucky, broke even and made a profit of $1000. I thought breaking even and making extra profit would make me stop gambling. No.... I was wrong. Lost the profit of $1000, and spent 800 dollars of my paycheck chasing that high. To my understanding its not even about the money no more, I am chasing a rush. I even thought about taking ALL my savings and going all in, stupid as hell..... 

I am having dreams of hitting big. I would wake up in the middle of the night to check my balance to see if it was real ahahahahah. When I would wake up, I would have a strong urge to gamble and cant stop thinking about it. Gambling has changed my life. I stop going to the gym, I get annoyed easily, started to curse more than usual and so on.  

I am here to share my story, only been online gambling for about 3 months, but it is taking over my life. The most ridiculous part is that I know this, but the urge to gamble is strong. Thanks for reading. God Speed.

Hey everyone. Kinda weird writing this but I think this might help. I’ve lost over $30,000 of me and my families savings due to gambling.

But what’s next? This morning all I can think about is what I’ve done and how hard life will be with the amount of debt I’ve accrued. At 30 yrs old I’ve ruined our future.

Self Reflection - Day 1 again ,"I’m back to day 1… back to worrying about money for another month, back to missing out on social events, lonely weekends, and mood swings because of this stupid addiction. 

This has controlled my life for 5.5 years now. I am 32 years old.. I make pretty good money, I was setup with a debt free degree by my great parents and I have thrown it all away. Today that stops. It has to. If I waste any more of my life I’ll be stuck in this cycle forever. 

I’ve been doing a lot of soul searching today rather than my normal routine of drowning out the noise in my head with podcasts, music, YouTube etc. I think I’ve finally found my deeper issue/fear so I figured I would share it for anyone else it may help. 

I went through a breakup a few years ago.. I was already gambling. I wouldn’t say it caused the breakup nor made it worse. What it did do was put me back in the dating scene where I find myself looking for a woman who has her life together, a good career, motivation, etc all while I’m hiding this invisible addiction. Ive been nervous that I’ll meet the girl for me but she will go running when she finds out about my debt and lack of responsibility. The only way to get over these fears is to control what I can control. I can’t magically have an ideal savings account but I can control my debt which is the mountain I’ve been climbing endlessly. 

The reality is I have been trying to win my way out of this problem rather than attacking it head on. If I quit gambling today and focus on my debt semi aggressively I can be debt free my next August. If I try to find a shortcut like I have been for years I’ll be in this EXACT same spot come next August. 

So with all of that, I’m done. I’ll be posting here more regularly and can’t wait to post that update that my debt is behind me as motivation for everyone else. 

This post long and probably more helpful for me than anyone else. But it feels good to write it out and hopefully it can motivate a few others as well. Start your life fresh with me! We can do this!

Day 514,"Everyday you choose to abstain from gambling is considered a win. Recovery is not one size fits alls. Everyone’s recovery is going to look different. Do what works for you, don’t do what doesn’t. Find out your triggers, replace them with good habits or hobbies. Talk to others going through similar issues. Build or join a community of humans ( I say humans because we make mistakes, we’re not perfect, nor should we try to be. If anything we should try to be better than we were the day before). Seek out professional help with therapists, specifically gambling addiction specialist. If sports are a trigger, find something more productive to do than sitting around on your phone, watching sports.

"How do People Get ""Addicted"" to Losing Money? Confused On What the ""Reward""/Motivation for Gambling Addiction Is. Please Help I am Desperate","Hi all, I admit I am a gambling addict. I took out a bunch of loans in April to trade on the stock market and lost it all. Short story, I continued trading and yesterday lost $20k of my own cash. I am likely going to have to file bankruptcy, seriously. 

What is so confusing to me in all this is what is the ""reward"" of gambling addiction? For example, for drugs and alcohol, there is the obvious reward that it (temporarily) improves one's mood and feelings. 

But for me, when I am trading, all I feel is stress and adrenaline. Yes it feels good when a trade is going my way, but it is not a euphoric feeling, not something powerful enough that I would say to cause an addiction. 

I have also heard that gambling addicts are addicting to the feeling of losing, but I do not understand this at all. When I lose money trading, all I feel is intense depression and a sense of numbness. I fail to see any reward/motivation out of this

Essentially - I understand how the brain develops an addiction to alcohol and drugs because it is obvious of the effects of them. 

But as a gambling addict, I have no freaking clue why I am obsessed with gambling when all it causes is intense stress, obsession, depression, and losing money. 

I am looking for people to explain both in the brain and behaviorally, the science of how people get ""addicted"" to gambling?

How can people get addicted to losing money? It doesn't make sense to me. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fumrzh/how_do_people_get_addicted_to_losing_money/,0,17,1727892288.0

But my boyfriend works really hard and doesn’t have very much money, so I thought if I could win some extra money I’d be able to give it to him to help him buy a new car or something. I kept losing and chasing my losses. I don’t know what to do. I certainly can never tell him what I did. I just need someone to tell me it’s all going to be ok.

When will we stop lying to ourselves?,"Hey guys! It’s me the 24M with 34k$ in debt.

I kept relapsing and losing money. If I win some money, I will think about my huge loss and debt so I will gamble more! If I lose, of course I will keep depositing to chase that loss until all money is gone and all credit cards are maxed out!

I will keep lying to myself that I will stop gambling every time I lose all money. I will tell myself that I can do it and that day is my day 1.

But when the wound from the previous session gradually recovered, I will deposit money in with the thought that this will be my last bet, this bet will help me settle all things down.

As you guys all know. It will lead to bigger loss and I will keep digging my hole deeper.

Everything I say to myself about gambling is lies! Everything. I cant stop gambling. Only if this brain were changed by another, I may be able to quit this disease. 

Only new life can help me quit gambling!

But I am not here to take my life out. I am here to confess everything and stop lying to myself. I still have time to fix all this, but not with gambling!

I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

I am grateful that I’m alive and have basics of life covered. 

I am grateful that today is a new opportunity to learn and grow.

I am grateful that I have the last 24 hours to reflect on. It has been very tough and emotionally exhausting at home recently, especially with my son villainizing me all the time for all the wrongs he feels he has.  I unfortunately lost my shit on him last night and said nasty things to him like calling him a liar and ungrateful. I apologized to him this morning, and he didn’t seem to care. The same thing happened with him and my wife last week. 

I am grateful that I know I must refuse to play the victim - I have a role to play in our relationship and accept responsibility for my actions. I know I never would have been able to admit this when I was in the throes of addiction. 

I am grateful I can admit that I resorted to self destructive dopamine spiking behavior after he and my wife went to bed, because I couldn’t handle what was going on inside and the strong feelings of failure I was having as a parent. I can and will do better next time to face and bear through whatever feelings come up inside. 

I am grateful that I know I’m not alone. I know this is typical of his age and that i need to show him extreme patience and understanding. It’s just so f’n hard sometimes. 

I am grateful I have a forum to share this, and hopefully I will use this experience to help me continue on my spiritual path towards serenity and peace. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ftvjy9/696_days_gratefully_without_a_bet/,4,1,1727808017.0

I’ve booked with a therapist, also been considering about going to gamblers anonymous. If anyone has managed to beat their gambling addiction I would love to hear how and what you did.

I don’t want to be that person again. I want to be clean.,"Hey all.

I just want to vent a bit and share some experiences hoping it will help me combat this and possibly others.

I have gambled for about a month last year, lost a few thousand and decided to quit in december 2023. Self-excluded my accounts from the two websited I have played and decided to move on with my life. Until a few months ago… as a blunder I have decided to give it a shot again and it became more miserable and more intense than last year. I lost tens of thousands in the span of few months. My cigarette consumption has doubled. I can’t sleep as well as before. I am not interested in ANY social, sexual activity or any hobby. I was consumed by gambling.

I AM DISGUSTED BY THAT VERSION OF ME. But somehow I was finding myself depositing day after day. Sure not everyday was losing. But even in the profit days I am sure the stress have taken a few years from of my life…. The hair pulling, desk punching, screaming sessions.

At first I was enjoying it. Taking the losses like a champ and enjoying the winnings. But it pivoted to a point where the only enjoyment I get from winning was having more ammo to gamble. I am pretty sure if I had unlimited money I could gamble until I simply drop dead infront of the computer. Knowing this makes me want to vomit. 

I finally went to a doctor today. I was prescribed two medicines and talked through several steps to take my attention from gambling and focus it into my old (new if possible) hobbies, my work and my family. I sincerely hope I will prevail… 

The money I lost is not so little for me but it will not make me broke. I will struggle a bit but I can recover if I prevent myself from dumping more money into this pit. Any help is appriciated!

I cannot anymore,"Need to vent right now,

Been trying to quit for almost a year. My gf already gave me a chance and I fucked it up, if she find out or if I'm telling her I will loose her, and I can't. 

I can't stand having money, I always end playing It on F****** online shit, had some dark thoughts recently.

I'm not too much in debt and thankfull for that, but god, always feeling like having the head under water is such hard to live with, I feel like i'm missing my own life, living on the side, I want to embrace it, not slowly dying while not enjoying anything cause eh I never got any money, and that's totally my faut. 

The worst part is at the beginnin of the month, when I got that sudden boost of confidence that I will play 50$ then stop, and of course I never stop, and of course I regret it afterwards, this is a run against the time, and I cannot win. 

Please give me new advices, things that made you changed definitely, I don't want to stay like that. Give me advices to kill this damn confidence I always get back.

"Relapsed, posting for accountability","Lost a lot, stayed clean for 10 days, relapsed with what I had left, stayed 11 days clean and relapsed again today... It wasn't a big one, but still. It has reintroduced in my mind and in my guts that feeling of unsecurity. I feel ash in my mouth and I feel cold.

I've stopped smoking and weed pretty effectively in the past. These addictions are not the same, but I feel like I'm in the end of gambling pattern. I don't know how to explain it really but how it worked so far for me is that the rebounds are smaller and smaller. Getting more and more certain and consicous about how it disgusts me, and I lose envy to go back to it.

Right now the dominant feeling in my head is shame that I have posted encouraging messages here to people who posted their despair, and i betrayed them by going back in myself. fuck this gambling shit man, this part of me dies today. I had progressively a better time over the last 11 days I was clean, and this small relapse took that away from me, and that pisses me off.

I followed the advice i received from many people i talked to in DM, i talked to a friend about how much I lost. He showed compasion and understanding, and it did feel good, even though it didn't really cured the bad feelings.

Objectively I guess I look like a fool, battling with my addiction and telling myself stories while I relapse. But I will carry this cross this time. I am done. This whole thing has been going on for too long alrealdy.

I posted before how I previously tried to fight urge of gambling (making a financial plan, blocking sites and stuff, listening and reading people's stories.. etc). To be totally honest, I know how much of a fool i made of myself until now, but I will be kind to myself one last time by considering that the couple relapses I had (this one included) were smaller and smaller, and made me more and more determined to leave this viscious cycle of chasing my losses. Now has come the time to act responsible for me, my future and my fiancée.

Farewell online slots and casino websites. You beat me, you took my money and you made me look like an idiot. I understand now that I could have never win anyway. And the several times that I won, I instantly forgot the promesses i made to myself and gamble away my winnings even faster.

You who read this, I also commit to you that you are ready something real, that can give you the hope that it's possible to stop.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ftp8kk/relapsed_posting_for_accountability/,1,5,1727792344.0

Day 512: Life gets better,"To anyone struggling with a gambling addiction, I want to send a message of hope: You are not alone, and recovery is possible. Every step you take toward healing, no matter how small, is a victory. It may feel overwhelming at times, but remember, change is within reach. Many who once felt trapped in their addiction have found freedom, and you can too.

Here are some tips to help you on your journey to quit gambling:

1. **Acknowledge the Problem**: The first step is recognizing that gambling has become harmful in your life. Once you admit this, you can begin the process of healing.
2. **Reach Out for Support**: Connect with others who understand what you're going through. Support groups like Gamblers Anonymous (GA) or online communities can offer encouragement and accountability. Consider talking to a counselor who specializes in addiction recovery. I started a discord server for those struggling with a gambling addiction and looking to recover: [https://discord.gg/RSpp4EYM](https://discord.gg/RSpp4EYM)
3. **Identify Your Triggers**: Know what situations, emotions, or environments lead you to gamble. Awareness of your triggers will help you avoid them and cope in healthier ways.
4. **Set Financial Boundaries**: Take control of your finances by limiting access to money. Hand over financial control to a trusted friend or family member, or set up blocks on your devices to prevent gambling sites.
5. **Develop New Habits**: Find healthy alternatives to fill the time and emotional space that gambling once occupied. Hobbies, exercise, or spending time with loved ones can redirect your focus.
6. **Take One Day at a Time**: Recovery doesn't happen overnight. It’s okay to take it one day—or one moment—at a time. Celebrate your progress, and if you stumble, don’t lose hope. Every day is a new opportunity to move forward.
7. **Stay Persistent**: Quitting gambling may be challenging, but persistence will pay off. Recovery is a journey, not a destination. Stay committed to your well-being and remember that the struggles of today are part of building a brighter, more fulfilling future.

You are stronger than the urge to gamble, and your life beyond addiction is full of possibilities. Keep going—you are worth it.

"4 years free, it’s possible!","Hello everyone! I’m new to this page but I see many people here at the beginning of their journey and I just want to say that I know the saying is cliche, but admitting you have a problem really is the hardest part. I participated in problem gambling, starting at ages 18 with my first scratcher. I did service industry work during my problem, and when I turned 21 I immediately turned to online slots. I couldn’t tell you how much money I lost because almost every cent of my paychecks went to online AC casinos and my cash tips went to scratchers. I admitted my problem to a friend when I was almost 22, but didn’t receive much support. A few months later in 2019, I placed myself on the online gambling self exclusion list for NJ, and finally admitted my problem to my therapist and psychiatrist. They gave me professional help and, minus one single lapse in 2022, I am free and happy. My big challenge that made a huge difference was not losing all of my pandemic unemployment payments that were quite large. The self exclusion really helps, and I just renewed it in July. I just want to say I’m proud of all of you for the steps you take to be better every day. It really is a one step at a time journey, and I know you all will be successful.

Videos Games - Gambling Addiction,"It’s becoming increasingly clear that there’s a strong link between video gaming and the risk of developing gambling addiction. Many gamers are exposed to mechanics in games that mirror gambling behaviors—such as loot boxes, microtransactions, and other forms of chance-based rewards. These mechanics train the brain to chase rewards through repetitive behavior, often reinforcing risky decisions.

When you’re used to that kind of dopamine-driven reward system, it’s easier to transition to real-money gambling because the mindset is already there. Studies have shown that people who game frequently, especially in games with gambling-like features, are more likely to engage in actual gambling and potentially become addicted  .

The problem is that video games normalize taking risks for a potential payoff, whether it’s an in-game item or currency, which can later transfer over to real-world gambling situations like sports betting, online casinos, or even high-risk stock trading. If you’ve noticed your gaming habits leading you to take bigger financial risks, you’re not alone. There’s growing evidence that the patterns you develop while gaming can affect how you handle real money. The key is to recognize those tendencies before they spiral into something more dangerous.

Anyone else experienced a similar connection between their gaming habits and gambling issues?",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ft6h5a/videos_games_gambling_addiction/,7,4,1727730004.0

How to find time for GA? Or similar group?,"Hi everyone,

I never had an account before but used to lurk this forum because I started seeing I had a big gambling problem. I got myself into debt because I'd pay all my bills and expenses (other than rent) with credit cards. And would gamble with cash at casino. I got a lot of debt for how much I make, so 2 months ago I got a 2nd job at a bar/restaurant evenings/closing and work 7 days a week between the two jobs. My only real ""down time"" is early mornings on weekends when I don't have my office job, and one day per week that I am not closing the bar. I don't have much time.

I relapsed this past weekend - both full paychecks after I paid rent. I even called off Sunday because I was up basically a month's pay from that job. Just spent the whole damn day gambling...came into Monday with nothing.

My question to you all is, how do I find time for a GA or a similar online group? My days are full of working hours and what little time I have to myself I use to sleep. It's a very monotonous and stressful, and boring, routine but it's what I need to do to get out of debt.

Beware of slot machines. ,"The gaming industry uses losses disguised as wins to motivate continued play. Despite a loss occurring, vivid colors light up, and sounds simulate winning, causing cognitive distortions and a dopamine rush. The participant is misled into thinking that they are winning more than they are. Furthermore, these machines are designed to create ""zone"" experiences.

Rock bottom once again,"Long story short, for the past 4 month i’ve been doing the same thing over and over, loosing money at the start of the month and living like shit for the rest. I really wanted to stop this month and get back on my grind, work, and get rid of my problems by taking action but ended up doing the usual. I was gambling, losing, winning, until i was down to being able to pay my rent which i also deposited, i eventually won 4.5k but then blew it without withdrawing, what is funny i did this to me on my birthday and now i just don’t know what to do. Was thinking about dropping out and working full time, but that wouldn’t really fix my problem, need to fix the root first. I can’t overdraft my card willingly, but if the bills are scheduled like rent and other bills, it can, but it’s not good. Today i’ll meet up with my mom, to celebrate my birthday, and i have to pretend like nothing is happened, she is not married and have her own struggles, so by me telling this, would destroy her mentally, if not physically, if i tell the full picture of a shit hole that i’m in. It’s really insane all of this, just wasting time, betraying my own family, no progress at all in life. I recently got fired from my job too, where i honestly also did some scammy things in order to gamble, but apparently it was not the reason i got fired. So right now i think the card is getting overdrafted with rent and other bills, I need to work my ass off this month, so i applied for waiter job, and one of my friend will help me with night shift job, and maybe DoorDash in between.

Almost Gambled Tonight - How Blocks Saved Me,"A few hours ago, while I was drunk, I almost gambled again. For about an hour, I kept trying to get into different sites, probably tried around 30 of them, but none of them worked.

 I even found two sites where my ban was set to end in a few months, but I quickly extended them to 80 years.

Honestly, if I wasn’t banned from these sites, this post would be very different. I'd likely be telling you how I wiped out my entire bank account. 

It’s taken me six months to save up what I have now, after all the stress of paying off loans.

For 12 months before that, I gambled away my entire paycheck month after month, and anyone who's seen my previous posts can verify the downfall I went through. Without these blocks in place, things would’ve been much worse.

I am grateful for this mornings meditation and the opporunity to learn how to handle multiple and complex emotions inside.

I am grateful for reminders that i am not the emotions I feel inside. I am the one who feels them. 

I am grateful for opportunities to slow down and observe when the power of the emotions I experience inside leads to craving and aversion. I know the more I can sit with, accept, and be comfortable with what’s going on inside, the less drawn ill  be to dopamine spiking activities like eating, playing video games, and of course gambling and trading. 

I am grateful that my fsmily had the maturity to sit and discuss tense topics with my son’s therapist last night. 

I am grateful for the opportunity today to be more patient, supporting, and  understanding with my son, especially as he learns how to listen better and not jump to conclusions so quickly and stubbornly. 

I am grateful that that same lesson to him also applies to me too. I know that the more I am mindful, the easier it is for me to listen. 

I am grateful to see that immature boy inside me who still needs to grow up. It’s time for me to start unconditionally supporting him and help him, just like with my son. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fss1mw/695_days_gratefully_without_a_bet/,7,0,1727691068.0
Day 1: Turning My Life Around – Gambling Free,"Hey all,

I have been silently (few posts here and there) lurking on this sub for a while now, reading all the ""lost my savings again"" posts and thinking, ""Yes that's me. That is my life."" Today, though, I have decided it’s time for that to change.

This year alone, I've lost over £40k. Last week? Another £10k down the drain. And over my lifetime, I’ve blown about £200k. Yep, £200,000 of my own hard-earned money. The number feels unreal just typing it out. I have lied to the people around me. I have lied to myself.

I’ve said I’d quit countless times, put gambling bans in place, self-excluded for months, but somehow, I always found a way back. It’s a disgusting cycle. But today... *today* is the day I say enough is enough. After losing, something has clicked (why couldn't it have clicked sooner aye). This isn't just about the money anymore, though God knows that’s a huge amount. It’s about the time I’ve wasted, the mental toll, the unhealthy disconnect I’ve developed with money - it is true I can gamble £1000 on a single game of Football, but paying £10 for lunch is a nightmare. 

I don’t want this life anymore. I want to change. I *need* to change. I want to get stronger, faster, healthier – mentally and physically. I want to reclaim all those hours spent gambling and turn them into something meaningful. Maybe I’ll learn a new language or pick up a sport. Hell, I’m even open to trying something fun just for the sake of it, instead of chasing losses I’ll never get back.

Here’s the big one – I’ve booked a session with a counselor. That’s massive for me. I hate talking about my feelings and this addiction has been something I’ve buried for so long, but I know this is a step I need to take.

So, here I am. Day 1. I know it’s going to be hard, but I’m tired of the lies, tired of the losses. I’m doing this for *me*. No more lurking, no more excuses. This is my start.

If you're in the same boat, let’s do this together. One day at a time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fsrrlc/day_1_turning_my_life_around_gambling_free/,24,9,1727689891.0

Take it as it is.,"Somehow this song helped me with my urges and here are the lyrics. My favorite version is (Driftwood - Aselin Debison) There’s also a male version (Driftwood - Travis) 

Everything is open
Nothing is set in stone
Rivers turn to ocean
Oceans tide you home

Home is where your heart is
But your heart had to roam
Drifting over bridges
Never to return
Watching bridges burn

You're driftwood floating underwater
Breaking into pieces pieces pieces
Just driftwood hollow and of no use
Waterfalls will find you bind you grind you

Nobody is an island
Everyone has to go
Pillars turn to butter
Butterflying low

Low is where your heart is
But your heart has to grow
Drifting under bridges
Never with the flow

And you really didn't think it would happen
But it really is the end of the line
So I'm sorry that you turned to driftwood
But you've been drifting for a long long time

Everywhere there's trouble
Nowhere's safe to go
Pushes turn to shovel's
Shoveling the snow

Frozen you have chosen
The path you wish to go
Drifting now forever

And forever more
Until you reach your shore
You're driftwood floating underwater
Breaking into pieces pieces pieces

Just driftwood hollow and of no use
Waterfalls will find you bind you grind you
And you really didn't think it would happen
But it really is the end of the line

So I'm sorry that you turned to driftwood
But you've been drifting for a long long time
You've been drifting for a long long time
You've been drifting for a long long
Drifting for a long long time",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fsq236/take_it_as_it_is/,4,2,1727681863.0
Jailed over Gambling,"A guy I met in a gambling recovery group just went to jail. He relapsed, scammed someone out of desperation to fuel his addiction, and now he’s not only behind bars but also homeless. What started as chasing losses led to him losing everything—his freedom, his dignity, and any stability he had left.

This is where gambling can take you. It doesn’t just cost you money; it destroys your life piece by piece. Each time you think, “I’m done, I’ll stop after this,” you’re playing with fire. And the next time? It could be much worse. Jail, losing your family, your job, or even your life—it’s a downward spiral if you don’t stop now.

Take this as a warning. Things only get worse for a gambler who doesn’t quit. Don’t wait for your rock bottom to be behind bars or on the streets. If you’re telling yourself you’ll stop after the next bet, that next could be your last chance before everything crashes down.

Day 292: I shall now unveil the secret to beating the casino....don't give them a single red cent! ,"We all think a jackpot will beat the casino. Wrong. I lost track of my 5 figure profits. The casino didn't give a shit about them. 

Why? Because I always gave the profits back plus interest plus a piece of my soul. 

I got a ""President"" level players card. The sportsbook manager told me how much he ""appreciated me."" 

Fuck that! I want the casino to hate me. And now happily they do. I am not filling their coffers. I am not adding to the manager's bonus. I am no longer the sucker they embrace in their sick game. 

Use this as motivation please. Refuse to be the casino's cash cow, welcomed guest or preferred player.

Day 1 - New Here,"I heard about this subreddit yesterday while listening to a podcast about problem gambling on my way home from another $5000 down the drain, student loan money that is supposed to help me finance school and live comfortably while I pursue my doctorate.

I was up all last night researching stories of people who killed themselves because of this addiction and found one about a man who jumped off the 6th floor of my casino parking garage in 2017. I started planning what day this week, where to board my dog so he’s taken care of, who to write letters to, etc. 

My level of planning scared me so I took some of my prescribed medicine to sleep for most of the day to stop these thoughts and urges. When I woke up all I could think of was how I’m going to go back to starving myself (former ED) or maybe cut (former cutter) because I’m worthless and deserve to hurt myself if I am going to stay alive. It’s 9 PM now so I’m going to try to find a GA meeting. Life feels pointless without gambling or a quick solution to recover what my short 3 month addiction has taken from me. But I’ll try to abstain again tomorrow. I hope this gets better.

Do something for you!,"I’ve posted something similar in the past but I think it’s a helpful reminder around payday. 

Just because you are deep in debt because of this addiction doesn’t mean you should torture yourself. Go out with friends or a loved one, buy a video game, or whatever you are into. If you cut out everything you enjoy because you feel like you should punish yourself it only makes quitting more difficult. You need to start building up those good feelings from things other than gambling. 

What has worked for me is basically paying off my debt at about 80% of the full pace that I could. I used to always put together plans that had every dime I earned going towards one bill or another. That just had me always living paycheck to paycheck and looking to gambling for a shortcut. Sure I’ll pay more in interest, but looking at that number it’s literally nothing compared to the debt I would add in even a month of gambling.

M 22 Relapse/Life Update,"M 22 Relapse/Life Update

251 days ago I posted in this community about how I had gambled almost all of my savings of 20k+ away down to around 5k. I had dropped out of college and was trying to figure out what to do with myself and my life. Well, 8 months later of working 3rd shift in a factory everyday just trying to save back up I fucked up once again. I was doing so good not gambling and I had saved up almost 16k again just until this past week when I relapsed got down a few thousand and lost 10k chasing. Now I’m back to 6k to my name and still don’t have any real direction in my life. I despise/hate myself all the above. I’m tired of this constant battle, I’m tired of feeling how I do every single day. I have the same conversation over and over every time i talk to a family member which is what I’m gonna do with my life. I feel embarrassed about where I am in life and now I just put myself even further behind financially. I don’t know why I decided to gamble again it just happened and that was that. I have no excuses for myself, I can’t tell my mom or anyone else that I relapsed. I’d rather disappear and never be seen again before I have that conversation again. I tried to get into the trades last year to start an electrician apprenticeship but who knew it’d be so difficult to get a foot in the door and now I’m battling the thought of it taking 2-3 years to even make a livable wage going that route. I am still fairly young but I’m tired of wasting my life. Everything i’ve seemed to do in my life since I graduated high school in 2020 has just been a big fuck up. I live a normal life divorced parents but come from a middle class family. I struggle with depression and anxiety which does put a burden on me but I feel more so it’s because my constant battle with myself. I am smart and I’m a hard worker, I know I’m capable of doing such greater things with my life but that’s when it comes back to me just carelessly fucking up my life more and more.

Observation this weekend,"So this weekend, my home casino in Vegas, flew me and several others out to a casino out East. They paid for airfare, hotel and some other things. 

The ONLY reason I agreed is bc the casino was not attached to the hotel. You had to take a shuttle over to the casino. Not as convenient as taking an elevator down to the casino.

I brought my daughter with me, she is not a huge gambler and more interested in seeing the sites back east (which we did).

Before we left, I took $650 cash with me. I was going to leave my debit card with my husband but decided not to. I had in my mind, the $650 was it. 

First night there,I played and left. Don’t chase a win or the atm. 
Played again next night - played and left 

Last night, same thing. 

What I don’t understand is this .. I walked away. I wasn’t upset or wanted to even keep trying for more. I was content . When at home, I would be chasing for more or running to the ATM until that dread hit and I realized how down I was. 

The ONLY thing that maybe a connection is my husband noticed an uptick in my casino visits at home and I had discontinued Naltrexone which my psychiatrist prescribed off label for gambling (if you have questions you can message me). I restarted a few days before the trip - so maybe that was it ? 

Has anyone else experienced this when away from their home casino ? It was odd, but odd in a good way. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fsewio/observation_this_weekend/,1,2,1727644302.0

"How to cope, big loss at 22","I began working full time this time last year. Just hit my one year. Before that I was in a rough time and gambled all my money away, which was around $10,000. Upon getting this job, I started getting my checks and gambling it away every single time. From September 23 to the new year of 24, I lost another about 8k. I work a commission job, so by January I started making good money. From January to about May, I lost another 40k. I was taking home about 6,500 a month, and losing it time after time. In about June, I started bringing 8-8.5 home a month after tax. Around May I finally stopped losing my ass fully. Still was losing here and there but no everything. I have about 23K to my name, owe 6, and taking a vacation that will cost about 3k. Just hit my year mark, and it just hurts to know at 23 I SHOULD have around 60+ thousand dollars to my name, with no debt. Instead I have around 20. This year was crucial for me to build up and I blew it. I make good money now, but I work in timeshare and the end of the year will be slow season so I doubt I will continue to bring a solid 8K per month. It hurts more now after the fact that I basically have kicked my gambling addiction, knowing I gambled 40-50k away in a year of work, getting up working my ass off everyday, just to give it away. In my department I am either top producer or 2nd every month. I will continue to work hard and make decent money, but knowing I’m going into slow season and it will take atleast 6 months to get back what I lost hurts like hell. Its literally all I think of constantly, from my waking moment, to when I go to bed. I guess I’m looking for support and advice, and mainly how to cope/forget about my loss and stay strong.

My husband is a compulsive gambler ,"I’m separated now from my husband. 20 years married. Separated since January. Two pre teen kids. 
He’s been a gambler all the time I’ve known him. A few years ago he lost €200k in a few months. I didn’t know until it was done. He earns well but he lied about everything and I was the one picking up the slack as I earn more. He had also lied to get significant money from his parents. We separated for 4 months but got back together. 
This time I’m done. But he has gambled more and more since he’s left the family home. He’s also an alcoholic. I can see him losing his employment soon and he’ll probably lose his house. Any inhibiting effect my being present in his life is gone. It wasn’t much to begin with but I did have oversight of his account after the 200k loss. He still did what he wanted. But I could see. 

The knock on effect of the gambling and drinking worsening and him losing his house means he’ll come looking for money from me in a divorce. And the gambling and alcoholism is destroying his relationship with his kids. I am now doing 95% of the parenting. 
He has never had any real interest in recovery. After big losses he’ll admit he has a problem. Cut to 48 hours later and he’s in control of it and he’ll sort it and blah blah blah blah x 100. 

So here’s my question - I’ve done everything. Truly. I loved him, I supported him. I said I’d do anything to help him. I paid his debts. I didn’t pay his debts. I went to gam anon. I tried cajoling, threatening, supporting, loving, begging, getting contact for recovery. 

Is there anything that anyone can do? Does he need to die? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fs9wz8/my_husband_is_a_compulsive_gambler/,18,20,1727631391.0
Building an AI Tool to Bring Recovery Meetings to You – My Journey as a Problem Gambler,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been a problem gambler since my junior year of college, and it’s been a battle ever since. I remember chasing losses so badly that once, I sold my clothes and Xbox just to bet again. I’m 30 now, and even though I’ve made more money in my career, the numbers I bet have only gotten bigger. I still don’t have much of a strategy—just chasing the next win. I lose a lot of money, it hurts, and I tell myself I’m done...but when the next NFL Sunday rolls around, that feeling wears off, and I want more action.

It all started back in college when I was about 18. Gambling wasn’t even legal yet, but it was everywhere. Every guy I knew at my state school was doing it. Over the years, gambling added so much stress—I even missed nights out with friends just to stay home and watch sports for my bets.

I’ve tried quitting. I deleted apps, set deposit limits, but I’d always download another app or remove the restriction when the urge came back. It’s not just sports gambling either—this addiction bled into **crypto** and **short-dated options**. I got lucky and made money with crypto, but this year, I had to quit because it was weighing on me mentally.

One thing I always struggled with was actually **getting myself to go to recovery meetings**. I wanted to learn from them, but I just couldn’t bring myself to attend. That’s why I’m building this tool—to **modernize the recovery process**. I’m building a **free AI tool** that listens to recovery meetings, pulls out the key insights, and sends them straight to your inbox or posts them online. No need to attend meetings or listen to hours of audio—you’ll get the highlights and advice that actually matter, straight to you.

**To be upfront**, this tool isn’t fully built yet. I’m building it for myself and people like me who don’t have the time or energy for traditional methods but still need support. This isn’t a promotion or a sales pitch—there’s nothing to buy. I just want to create something useful for this community.

If you’re interested in **helping me shape the tool** or providing feedback, drop a comment, **DM me**, or sign up for updates (link provided only if allowed by mods). I’d love to hear from others who are in the same boat and can offer insights on what would be most helpful.

Thanks for reading, and I’m looking forward to being part of this community. I’m also happy to share more about my journey if anyone is going through something similar.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fs78f5/building_an_ai_tool_to_bring_recovery_meetings_to/,0,0,1727624446.0

I don’t see how it’s possible  Not even for popular YouTubers like Crackpot Judo or Cowboy Snots.  I mean there have been many times I’ve won numerous j@ckp0ts in one visit to the casino but still never was ahead because it’s just up and down but mostly down.  

Q2 - If a person was playing slots and the machine sucked up their money like a blood thirsty vampire on every machine, and they got ticked off and pounded a machine with their fist breaking the spin button, should they pay to fix it?  After all, the casino just ruthlessly sucked up perhaps hundreds or thousands of dollars from that person. Shouldn’t the casino figure that’s the price they should pay for exploiting people?

I even prayed for self-control when it came to gambling so that I wouldn't lose everything chasing losses if I did lose but that prayer wasn't granted/honored.

On day 2, an older woman I met and had a conversation with spoke life into me and convinced me to push to live longer and convinced me that this too shall pass.

Now on day 3, I prayed to God and the universe to give me a way out of all this financial mess and these financial challenges without gambling. I honestly don't know what's real anymore as in what to believe in other than what I see. I am not too stable these days but I'm still alive and trying.

Is ego the enemy?,"I never read the book.

Gambling-related cognitive distortions ,"A previous post did an excellent job of explaining one of the gambling-related cognitive fallacies: the gambler's fallacy. Researchers have identified others. These researchers may use different names for these fallacies. The five most frequent are as follows.

1) The Gamblers fallacy is often called the Monte Carlo - or predictive control due to the expectation of imminent wins after a losing streak, ignoring the laws of probability. The hot hand is similar, but it is a reverse philosophy. This fallacy refers to the assumption that an outcome that has happened repeatedly is ""hot"" and will continue to prevail.

2) Interpretive Bias explains that an individual's memory is biased toward overestimating wins and underestimating losses, which may influence the development of problem gambling. For example, a series of vague losses may follow a vivid win, at which point the win is remembered, and the system is reset.

3) Positive expectations are beliefs that gambling will produce a positive outcome, such as financial gain or positive feelings.

4) The illusion of control is an expectancy of success probability based on special knowledge or ability. Examples may include thinking one can control the outcome of random events through interventions such as practicing ritual behaviors, believing one has personal traits or luck as an attribute, owning lucky objects...

5)  loss of control is the perceived inability to stop gambling, often called. This refers to the thought that one’s gambling is overpowering and that the gambler is helpless. Loss of control has been identified as the primary driver of problem gambling.

The Gambling Related Cognitions Scale is an instrument developed by Raylu and Oei to measure these five cognitive distortions specific to gambling.

"Down $44,000 in 3 weeks","Title says it all. I feel disgusted with myself, I am a 34 year old male who has had gambling struggles in the past and I was away from this for 2 years before I got into it again.

It all started when my friend who is new to stocks started talking about how excited he was to invest at the start of the year. Before this, I just put $2.5k a month into an ETF and led it ride. Well these conversations made me want to try options trading for a second time after getting burned in 2021. 

I started spot trading and making decent swings, and of course with spot you dont lose the money based on a set time..then I tested the waters with $80 trading spirit airlines options before it announced financial issues. I doubled that $80 in 10 minutes and i was hooked all over again.

The past 8 months have been filled with highs and lows. I actually made it to $10k profit after 2 months, only to be down $27k of my initial capital 2 months later by making rookie mistakes.

I managed to get out of the hole again from June to August, being net profitable $23k until recently..

When the fed announced rat cuts $spy went almost vertical for 3 weeks straight. I kept buying weekly puts, averaging down positions, letting them expire worthless, complete recklnessness compiled with getting drunk everyday to ease the anxiety. As it stands today I went from being profitable $23k YTD 2 weeks ago to in the hole -$21k. 

I havent really eaten or slept much this week. My diet consisted of binging alcohol and water with maybe 1 meal each day. What hurts the most is the time wasted and doing the bare minimum at my job to stare at charts all day. I am laying on my couch right now with no appetite, sitting in the dark, and asking myself why am I too proud and greedy to admit I was wrong and didnt just walk away? If i stopped 3 days ago I would only be down $2k but instead I am now down $21k. Not to mention the s&p 500 is up 31% in 1 year and I should have just let my money ride. I want to end my life and cant stop staring at my phone to check the price of stocks. I dont want to work for months then take 3 steps back losing months of paychecks because I have no self control.

Topic:  “Detaching with love""

Sometimes we have to let go of people, places or things to protect our sobriety. This includes emotional attachments that may create stress that drives us into gambling to ""take a break"". 

Today, let's discuss a time when you made the decision to distance yourself from a person, a place or a thing to protect your sobriety.

Reasons to stop gambling ,"1. Gambling is a BIG fat LIE. Its a TRAP. 
All winnings are temporary.  Winning just makes you believe in this delusional LIE called gambling.  While the only way to earn money is by hard work and patience. 

2. We all wanna enter heaven one day. (The beautifull kingdom of God). And this is what the word of God says :

(Timothy 6.9-12)

Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. 10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.

11 But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness. 12 Fight the good fight of the faith

"You will never stop by just ""being strong""","Gentlemen,

  
after reading couple of posts, i feel like you are all (including comments) approaching this in a too vague of a manner. 

You will never stop by just ""being strong"". Your brain wants the dopamine you get from gambling. You are literally trying to fight chemistry of your brain. You are not strong enough! Almost noone is.



What you need to do is NOT to think about gambling at all, instead of ""fighting the urge"". How? Well:

  
1. do other shit - but actually tell yourself what shit your gonna do. Not just general ideas of ""keep yourself busy"". I've bought myself a Guillows Balsa airplane first time in my life. That stuff was suffering, but it kept my mind off things for entire month.

2. put yourself into environment which doesnt enable this behaviour. If you always gamble on your phone when you are on the toilet, then dont enable this environment. Buy a book and take that to the toilett instead? 

3. Get yourself addicted to something else: Now this is iffy :D This point is for people who posted 16th ""Day 0"" post in this month. You are beyond normal, boring help. Admitting this is the first step, i swear if someone downvotes this, you are living in a dream world. I can say im fucking addicted to Youtube and Chess in a completely sick manner. BUT i am never depressed that i lost my paycheck, i can actually eat food cause i have money. I spend unhealthy amount of time there. Make no mistake, i realise how bad it is. But i classify this as better than gambling.

Online Gambling - My biggest problem,"Hi,
first of all, sorry for my english, I am not native speaker and I am currently in my breakdown, so I think it can be possibly not perfect. 

My whole gambling story starts before 18, legal age of gambling in my country, with CS:GO cases and sites that offers this cases. It was like 4 years ago and my problem only escalated over time.

I starter small, like everyone I think, some 5-10$ deposits and small risk, always cashout some skins.

After my 18th birthday I wanted to try something „better” - normal online gambling. Once again I started small deposits, but it went up so quickly. 

After only few months I losted all my savings and have started to take loans, to „bounce back”. 

After that I realized that I am doing something wrong and I put it aside, not for long tho, only 6 months.

When Euro2024 started I wanted to have some more fun watching matches, so I betted. Of course It was a winning bet, so I get back into this shit.

Currently I am unemployed and with 2k$ loans. I’ve been to specialists and they really can’t help. I don’t know what I can do to stop it, even with this loans I want to take more and all money I got, I am spending to gamble. I tried site blocking, with gamban, manually, but it never works for me, I always find trick how to play.

Day 640. I finally put some money on the stock market,"I eventually put 5K on the stock market with the purpose to hold them the longer possible, ideally some decades God willing. This is something that I always wanted to do, but always the urge for quick profit made me turn quickly into more active gambling games and eventually lose everything fast. This time I will try to be consistent with the long term plans. Yesterday I felt a bit like gambling, a bit of stress about how the stocks will move, etc but nothing compared with the roller coaster of other games like slots, poker, horse racing, sports betting, etc I will keep monitoring my stress levels and the general emotional affection. If I notice high levels of stress or significant disturbance on my daily life and work performance I will sell everything instantly

I know that there will be days with deep red, I am prepared for them, I hope I will resist to turn into other games for loss chasing and fast profit. Having stayed clean for the last 640 days is a huge weapon against all the other gambling shit except from long term stocks and bonds investing.

I will keep posting here as a diary of feelings and thoughts. There is no other place where I can talk freely about gambling emotions and thoughts.

I will be honest, there was a bit of boredom last couple of weeks, this time of the year where winter approaches, the day becomes smaller, life outside reduces, and sports activity maximizes I always felt coming closer to gambling. I even played some demo slots last days. Also, I had some money saved on bank accounts, that I see them for many months staying there being eaten by inflation while the stock markets hit another all time high. It's not that the sirenes of stock market pulled me in, it's rather the fact that I want to possess some portion of these large companies that we all use in our daily life and move the entire economy. Companies like BAC, Apple, Samsung, Honda, Moody's, Pharma, etc There is really an entire world out there and me being in companies for my entire life as employee, and now having grown a bit older, I feel that they are the only game that can keep me interested.

To make things even more funny and a bit easier for me to choose stocks, I tried to imitate the portfolio of Warren Bufett! I will keep this plan for my next buys too and see how it goes. At the end, if I lose some thousands, Warren will have lost some billions and this is a bit of consolation :)

Another reason that made me take this decision is that I expect this to give me some motivation to work harder in this winter. I feel a bit slack and unmotivated last period in my work/business and I find my self not wanting to put a lot of effort. Really a couple of grands more in my bank account means nothing at all at this stage, while it means some more stocks in my portofolio and this sounds a bit of motivation.

Anyway, this post is mostly a page of a diary, I posted it as I have no other place to speak about more deep feelings and thoughts behind our actions.

I hope everyone is doing ok with the battle with gambling and have a great weekend!",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fr528d/day_640_i_finally_put_some_money_on_the_stock/,9,5,1727492701.0
Day 290: As Grandma once said: if you knew you were going to fall you would have sat down! ,"Don't beat yourself up for mistakes. We all make them. How we differ is in our response to those mistakes.

Forgive yourself. Some mistakes cost people their lives or put them in prison for taking another's life.

Why casino bonuses are a problem,"1. You must play that money first to hope for a return.
2. They are made to have returning customers who ultimately deposit funds.
3. They are given periodically to enable an addict to play more often.
4. Casino games are against your odds no matter what, House always wins.

Update ,"Posted in here a couple months back I believe, when I thought I was at rock bottom.  I kept gambling, I won about 60k back.  Told myself that the universe threw me a bone and I had to stop at that point.  I went and hid my money from myself in some stocks.  Bought a gold Rolex just to put a savings account on my wrist.  But Nope, it’s never enough.  I kept gambling, went to 0 again and then some.  I’m 21.  I’m making  well over six figures.  Gambling has ruined so much to the point where I can’t do it to myself anymore.  Download Gamban on all of your devices when you’re feeling motivated to stop gambling, it doesn’t let you just uninstall it either and gamble.  Go do it now.   I am already starting to feel better even tho I’m not back financially, my glass is starting to look half full and it’s a bit easier to sleep, wake up in the morning knowing I won’t have thousands of dollars on the line that day.

Can I help a friend?,"Hey, I really don’t know if I’m posting in the right sub but I’ll post anyway and if you want you can delete.

So I have a friend and he has a gambling problem, I hadn’t realised how bad it is until I helped him at his store for a while. He is betting a lot more than what I thought he was, I thought he was just betting about 200-300 per week but it’s closer to 80-100 per day and while that may not seem a lot to some of you it is a lot for his family’s financial situation. His mother and aunt run the family business and work like stupid hours, his aunt had cancer and they spend a lot for her therapies(she’s fine now but they still have to do some things). The business is also not doing that great and they have a lot of debt, he knows he has a problem, he has actually told me the phrase ""I don’t gamble to make money I just gamble to feel the rush"" but I think he is blind to how much damage it does to him. He has almost completely lost touch with our friend group of almost 15 years, he spends any money he makes on gambling and weed every single night, his family also don’t know and I feel bad for them because if he keeps this up he really is going to gamble everything they have under their name.We are also very young at 23 so this is in the early stages I think and could escalate a lot, before you say it’s not a lot of money just think that it’s everything he makes, if he made more I don’t think he’d gamble any less of a percentage of that than what he does. Don’t get me wrong I have my own vices and I consider my self a seasonal functioning drug addict but I’ve never let drugs affect my relationships or finances this much. 
Is there any way I can help? Should I speak to him? Did anything work with you while you were quitting?

Safe space? :(,"I’m so embarrassed. I started in April when I started a second job working my sister I used the money from that as like play around money. I also own a small business nothing crazy I make custom sweatshirts I work 24/7. I use to be so proud of where I was financially… then I was introduced to these stupid slot apps. I’ve had them all. I’ve deleted all my accounts. I finally just self excluded from bet rivers for 30 days. I’ll do it again after 30 days if I feel the urge to get on when I know the time is up.

Well anyway I’ve lost probably over 70K in personal money/earned money in 5 months. Some of that is probably wins too. Cuz I’ve won pretty decent, put it away, blew it all over again. I hit my first ever grand last week 90K gave my husband a cut and put away some in savings but blew 30K of it. I don’t know how to bet small so I bet big like a fucking idiot and lose it all chasing the loss. Literally a week ago I was like wow look at that we finally made it all back. And now I’m down again and embarassed. I even remember feeling content and never wanted to place another bet again. And look what I did.

I guess I’m thankful I have a savings. My credit cards are paid off. But I can’t stop thinking about how embarrassing the loss is!!!! Like I just had 50K more than normal and BLEW IT WHO DOES THAT. How do you get over that? I obviously can’t bring that money back. There’s literally nothing I can do but let it go and just work hard and get my mind right. 

I guess I just wanted to create a thread so people can relate, not feel bad about this horrible addiction. I have nowhere to put it. Literally nowhere.

"It all started with 1k, and now I’m down 250k in 6 months… this shit got me, y’all","I can't believe how fast things have spiraled out of control. It all started with just 1k—just a small gamble to see what it was all about. Won a bit, felt that rush, and then BAM—I was hooked. Now, six months later, I’m down over **250k** and my life is in ruins. I’m 20 years old, and I’m about to be homeless because of this gambling addiction. Here’s how it all went down.

At first, it seemed harmless. I was winning big—like **seriously big**—and it felt like I’d cracked some kind of code. I thought I could keep going, making more and more, but then came the losses. Around 100k in, I should’ve seen the writing on the wall, but I didn’t. I couldn’t stop. The losses consumed me. My mind was fixated on one thing: getting it all back. And that's when I went down the rabbit hole.

At this point, I wasn’t even a functioning person anymore. I wasn’t brushing my teeth, wasn’t showering, wasn’t doing anything except sitting there chasing my losses, thinking the next win would turn it all around. I started using my parents' money—mixing it with mine—and before I knew it, I was in a hole too deep to climb out of. I’m such a pathetic loser. Every time I’d win something back, I’d try to bet bigger, thinking I’d hit it big and be free. Spoiler alert: I didn’t.

I’m now at 250k in losses. There’s no job, no school, no future. My family is about to kick me out of the house, and I don’t blame them. I’m 20 years old, and I’ve wrecked my life before it even started. I can't even look at myself in the mirror anymore. The worst part? I don't have the guts to end it all, even though sometimes it feels like that’s the only way out. 

If you're thinking of gambling, stop before it takes everything from you.

It's been 1 month since I started playing the game again, if I remember correctly, it must have been about 2 years since I last played. 
My last loss was $500 and I said stop 
1 month ago I invested $6000 in crypto I lost around 60% on shitcoin and the rest at the casino

I ended up with zero and all I thought about was getting my money back 
so in a desperate act I stole $10,000 which I lost almost immediately at the Casino 

So today I have $500 left but for me the most important thing is not to get caught for the $10,000 it would ruin me but the current situation is already complicated

From Riches to Ruin: My Battle with Stock Market Gambling Addiction,"My name is X, and I am a gambling addict. I’ve never set foot in a casino or placed a sports bet, but I still ended up trapped in a form of gambling I never thought possible. Over the past four years, I have lost more than $65,000—money I worked hard for, every single cent earned through my own efforts. I’ve never been handed anything in life, yet I let it all slip away.

I used to be a different person. I traveled the world, experiencing life with a sense of freedom and joy. I remember the feeling of security, seeing a healthy balance in my bank account, knowing I was building a future. I was happy. I was content. I had a reputation as a nice guy—someone who was there for others, someone who embraced life with optimism. Now, all of that feels like a distant memory. 

Everything changed in 2021, when I started betting against the stock market. I’m an economist; my models and instincts told me we were in a bubble, so I bet on a crash. But the market kept rising, defying all logic, and every time I doubled down, convinced the correction was just around the corner. Instead, my finances imploded. I’ve lost over 60% of my savings. But what’s worse, I’ve lost more than just money—I’ve lost my sense of self, my happiness, and any love I once had for life.

Now, I feel empty. Numb. All those feelings I used to have—joy, excitement, even kindness—are gone. In their place is a deep resentment for what my life has become. I hate the person I see in the mirror. I hate that I’ve let this disease take over my life. My family knows what I’m going through—my parents, my wife—but I’ve told them I don’t want financial help. I told them so they could hold me accountable, not to bail me out. They shouldn’t have to pay for my stupidity, and I need to feel the full weight of these consequences if I ever want to break free from this destructive cycle.

I’ve taken every possible step to cut myself off from this addiction. I installed Gamban, blocked my trading accounts, and contacted my brokers to permanently close them. I gave control of our savings to my wife. I pay the bills, and she keeps the rest safe. I’ve left no door open for myself to return to the stock market and gamble away our future again.

This is a terrible, insidious disease. It has stolen my life. For four years, I’ve been a prisoner to the market, obsessively watching stock tickers as my world crumbled around me. I was at the top, but now I’m at the bottom—broken, resentful, and unsure if I’ll ever be the person I used to be. But if there’s one thing I know, it’s that this pain is necessary. I need to face it, endure it, and find a way to rebuild, or I’ll never escape this hell.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fpt3kc/from_riches_to_ruin_my_battle_with_stock_market/,23,5,1727347039.0

Day 2,"Hey all.
Day 2 has been alright so far. I’ve been at work so no urges. I’m hoping that work becomes more satisfying and I become more motivated once I stop losing most of the money I’m earning… I’ve heard that enthusiasm towards working returns after a while so I have that to look forward to.

There’s one thing that I want to mention though, and I’d appreciate advice on this;

I still haven’t self excluded my stake account, as I still want to claim the weekly and monthly bonus before closing it (I had a big loss this month so the bonus will be decent, maybe a few hundred USD). I’ve set a loss limit of 0.01$ so it’s impossible to gamble, and I’ve deleted coin base so I’m not tempted to buy any crypto. 

The reason I’m doing this is not because I’m short of money, in debt or struggling financially. It’s because I want to treat myself, and more importantly my girlfriend. I’d like to embed it in my brain that it feels better to spend money on physical items or meaningful experiences than pissing it away chasing a high / losses. 

Thanks everyone ❤️❤️ stay strong and I’ll update you all tomorrow for day 3.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fpoj6l/day_2/,5,6,1727326786.0
