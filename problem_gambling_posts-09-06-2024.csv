Advice needed,"I’ve come to the realization that I am definitely a problem gambler about 2 years ago, it started off at 18 winning about $25,000 with my friends playing slots one night while I was home on leave from the military. I felt like it was so effortless in the beginning and easy. Little did I know that winning that was probably the worst luck I could’ve had. Fast forward 8 years now, and I can’t seem to get past not going to gamble my paychecks away. I self excluded with the state I’m in, but as soon as I found out one casino doesn’t participate in the state program I started going there as soon as I get any money. Outside of the casino I’m so frugal, and not impulsive with money. I’ve been doing weekly therapy sessions with CBT for two months now, and it helps. But I will have 28 great days, then 1 bad day and lose my entire monthly income. I don’t go for fun anymore, and it doesn’t matter if I win $10,000, I would still spin until I have nothing. I need help from someone who has been in my exact situation. I am aware that it’s an extreme addiction that I would not wish on anyone. My Wife and I are expecting the beginning of Dec, and I HAVE to position myself to be a supporter and provider. It’s so embarrassing and hard for me to admit it. I just need help. I want to start building back my relationship with money the right way. I’m honestly just terrified that I’ll continue down this same path even when I know it’s not right.  My spouse has always been supportive of me getting help, and has given me the ultimatums. My first step was separating my wife’s and I bank accounts so I can’t access our savings, etc. (A year now) Secondly, I banned myself for 10 years with the State-Wide self-exclusion program. (Every Casino Around participates but 1). Third, I’ve started therapy in Late July Weekly. 
I’m truly just tired of the same old loop. I know this is just a big rant, but please share your story, and give me some hope that I can make it through this. I make a good living financially, but it doesnt matter what I make if I lose it as soon as I get it. It’s very un responsible and immature, I’m so ashamed and disappointed that I even got here. Please share your experience and advice.

I didn't even know I was gambling but now I know I have a huge gambling problem,"It all started with the damn stock market. I didn't know anything, just buy good stocks & let them be. Then back in 2022 with market crash I saw the draw down, panicked and sold everything at a big loss.

Over the next few months, I got to know more about daytrading and started trying to figure it out. As the market was free falling, I was making killer money. In a few months, I made all my losses back and then more. I got cocky & delusional, I thought I am the king of this and I should quit my job.

Then the market turned around & I had my first big loss of trading. It went gradually downhill & as of today, I have lost it all.

I was always careful to never go to a casino, never bet a dollar in my life but now, I think I have become gambler before even knowing.

The urge to win it all back, the greed to make more & make my family proud, I was creating charities in my delusional mind to help people out. But now that I am looking back, it seems like a terrible gambling problem with a polished facade.

I have a toddler and I cannot even look her in the eyes. My wife doesn't know, nobody knows, beside you...

I want to end it all but having lost my own father early makes me know how bad it can be for her.

I am lost, I don't know what to do, I don't even know how I got to where I am. I still have a job, so glad I wasn't fool enough to quit it, it pays alright but I am in massive debt, 6 figures debt...

I keep getting the urge to win it all back, to come out a winner. I don't even know what the hell I am doing or thinking anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fak7yx/i_didnt_even_know_i_was_gambling_but_now_i_know_i/,4,2,1725642053,

Relapsed ,"Hi everyone,

I have relapsed again today and lost $1500 on the horses. I placed a $500 bet on the favourite paying $1.90 and it came 2nd so I started to chase my losses.

 I deposited $1000 to the bookies and decided to place a $500 bet on a $3 odd and $4 odds in the same race. The other $3 odd horse I thought wouldn’t win, actually wins !

 In the time of 4 years gambling I have probably lost $50k AUD. I’m not sure how I can stop gambling. I have signed up to bet stop, Australia. There’s time the urge gets to me and I gamble at the local Pub with TAB. I want to actually save money but can’t believe how hard it is. Any advice would be appreciated,

"Last Bet May 14th 2024 (Can feel the triggers. No retreat, no surrender)","I struggle with motivation, hopelessness and giving up quickly. I have a debt which is half my monthly income then i amofficially clear God willing. That being said i recognised my triggers are also sexual immorality, nicotine, soft drinks and isolation. 

It was deeply wired over years and the only way is to rewire my brain with other sometimes more difficult joys (that are more healthy such as sports, healthier diet, less screen time reading my Bible and listening to Christian Audio Books) such that i dont relapse. Whenever i see myself feeling depressed, stressed out, isolating myself then i  feel a relapse coming but i am taking steps to overcome this by staying on here for accountability. 

What i know is gambling is a killer and its stealing from me, my entire future. A few days ago i was playing a computer life simulation game(i dont recommend it anymore because it may lead to escapism or vicarious living instead of working on our real lives). I got to see how different types of lifestyles and small choices can lead me down a good (light) or evil (dark) path. Or affect the health, happines and life expactancy or life outcomes of those i love. Sadly in the game i had got a job, properties and was raising my kids. Spending time with my family and life was pretty good. I had a nice car, chose to work hard, any job even as a housekeeper and learn more. 

I would always steer clear of Gambling. Then one day i dont know why i played the lottery after a short while i went to an in game race course and placed a bet of 100,000 Fake Dollars. Even though it was just a game and i still lost my wife got angry and i think divorced me (cant remember). 

I started craving bets and slowly begun forgetting that on May 14th i was ready to end it all. In the past 7 days i tried logging back in to my old betting accounts but i was permanently banned from all the websites i registered in(Thank God). For this i thank Jesus Christ and all those, even those on the sub who recommend signing up and banning yourself from every website that is in your country. 

I basically told them, gambling is destroying my life and i will harm myself if they dont block me, my number, my ID and emails. I had to do this many many times on soo many apps but it stopped a relapse. They respond very quickly if you communicate with them in chat and let them know (without insulting them or cursing at them) just letting them know that you are legally warning them and they can be liable if anything happens to them. When we sign up we sign a contract with them, which we can terminate whenever we feel like through official communication. 

The Lottery just came to my country a few weeks ago and today i walked up to a terminal and wanted to place a bet. I thank God that the machine was broken. It sucks because in Africa with little regulation on almost every neighbourhood corner there is a betting shop and in Uganda even teenage kids, sometimes even middle school kids gamble. 

I ran away from the betting shop and im at a bistro/cafe/restaurant now trying to finalise my dissertation and the tempation is still there. I know if i beat it this time i will come out stronger on the other side.

The best time to stop is NOW,"I’ve been a compulsive gambler for many years, and I’ve lost so much money I can’t even count.

I tend to chase my losses, month after month. The moment I get my pay check, most of it would go straight down the drain in an attempt to recoup my previous months losses.

One day, a few months ago - I decided to put a stop to everything. Self exclusion on every platform. Depending on the country there may be services available that would self-exclude you from most known gambling websites. Even your bank may have features to help stop your gambling addition by blocking certain merchants.

Anyway, I’ve been gambling free for a number of months now - and since then I’ve managed to save up £5000. Aside from this, I’ve spent £2k on much needed dental care. Booked flights for the end of the year to visit family.

I have started building up an emergency fund, and I’ve been getting good financial advice from other subreddits on how to do this. 

If I didn’t stop gambling, I would have £0.00 in savings. My teeth would still be screwed up. I wouldn’t have a holiday/vacation to look forward to. 

Whoever is reading this, anyone that has just lost a lot of money - please use the tools available to you, to help block your ability to gamble. If you physically walk into casinos or gambling shops, you can ask them to ban you from them.

There’s no ‘short-cut’ in clearing debt or recovering from your losses. Even if you do get lucky, deep down inside you won’t quit and will end up losing your winnings. Please stop this, you are all worth much more than this. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1fa8frf/the_best_time_to_stop_is_now/,16,8,1725603744,
"You always lose, it’s never just for fun","The past 3 weeks I went on the adventure of ""taking advantage"" of the promos that every Sportsbook/casino app offer.  I thought I was a genius, gonna make a free couple of hundreds, and then delete everything and never touch those apps again.  It never works out the way you think it will.  You’re always chasing, and it’s never enough.  At moments I was up around $1000, only to end up losing around $1500-$2000.  Mind you, I was given over $500 of free bets in this time!  You literally never win because you never let yourself win.  You are addicted and you don’t have the willpower to change that.  It sounds harsh but it’s the truth.

Reading many of the posts in this thread, it’s sad, and I feel blessed that I’m still young haven’t lost that much, but I see that it can get worse and worse and worse until you’re left with nothing.  That’s the last place I want to be.  I want to be free of this, all of it.  I’ve set $1.00 deposit limits on all of these evil apps/websites, but the bottom line is that if you still have the itch, you’ll always find another way.  I need real help, and I plan on getting it.  You cannot win this battle alone.  You can’t even put up a fight alone.  It’s never a contest. You literally always lose.  If anyone want to help hold each other accountable every day, please reach out.  We can do this together.  It will never, ever be easy, but it can be done.

Pretty bad right now. ,"
I’m 20, and live in New Zealand. 

I found Stake.com through a youtube video sponsor about 3 months ago. I had never ever touched gambling in my life, and there was a time where I was strongly against gambling and lotteries etc. But I thought heck, why the hell not. Deposited $30, decided oh well if I lose it i’m not too bothered. 

I played a few rounds of dice and won $700 USD. 

This night, I stayed up to 2AM rolling this dice over and over and exploring the website, having the time of my life. Ended up with $800.
I withdrew this money and thought damn, I’m never gonna do that again. Take my winnings and never look back. I knew that at this point I wasn’t addicted to gambling or anything so I would’ve been capable of not doing it again.

A few months later I decided to revisit the website, looking for that buzz again. 
I won 2.3 grand. I have been insanely lucky, but obviously that luck didn’t go very far. Lost it all pretty quickly. 

As the months progressed, each pay check my deposits got bigger and bigger. And the losses got worse and worse. 

Yesterday I had $3,000 sitting in my balance which if I just withdrew that all my debt would have been repaid. 
But of course it’s all gone. Luckily I’m 20 and living with my parents so it’s not like i don’t have food on the table. But it’s still going to be a struggle over the next 2 months or so to pay off my credit card balance and probably accumulated interest. 

These websites have a way of tricking your brain into believing you can outstay your luck. I take full responsibility for everything I’ve done but man these games got into my head. 

I don’t know what i expect from writing this post if anything but I sort of just wanted to vent even if it is just into the void so I can stop myself from doing something stupid.

Cutting deeper each time,"Getting sad this point. How does the mind believe one can gamble when it knows it can’t. Went and gambled again and lost a chunk. Same old boring story. Believe you can have a small bet. Walk out down 10x what you initially wanted to stake. Lying to friends and family because your too ashamed of what you keep doing on a weekly basis. Just won’t seem to click in my head. I use to have a higher paying job and now I am earning less it seems worse as I feel like I’m out of pocket even after being paid and then believe I would of been happy with what I had after losing money. 

This addiction is relentless and it will not stop until you say it does. Unfortunately I haven’t found the will power to do so yet. But the thought of letting my family down and people around me is what gets to me the most. Myself I can deal with. Upsetting others and taking for granted  what they do for me is unacceptable. 


I hope I can truly beat this addiction one day. Today I didn’t. It’s a life long thing eh. Stay strong people and don’t do what I do, which si think you can ever gamble. No matter what amounts. Because it will get you eventually. A gambler is always a gambler and that’s the way it is. Although so hard to accept. That’s the way it is.

Just reflecting today on how it's the small things that make the gambling free life better. Some examples:

-yesterday I wanted to get lunch with a friend who needed a nice distraction, was able to offer without thinking ""but the money for lunch and taking a long lunch today could be spent at the slot place""

-we were out of coffee today, was able to just grab coffee and a treat for my husband and I today without asking for his card and not having a good reason to be out of cash myself 

-more focused at work and getting more done and not trying to leave gaps in my schedule for if I want to get away

-being focused on my child when at home and not distracted from stress

I'm far from perfect and life is far from perfect, I am still dealing with some of the damage this addiction caused, but overall life is so much simpler now.

Clearing debts can serve as a relapse slippery slope,"Reminder for those who are in debt:
One day, sooner or later, chances are, you will pay off your debts. 

Then you will feel great. 

Then weeks pass by. Maybe months.

Then chances are that you will think:
“I am now completely debt free, I have proved myself I am no longer addicted to gambling. I could burn a healthy amount, now that I have money!”

I did this and won a hefty amount only to give it all back in one bet the next day.

Hey guys! It’s me who posted on this group long time ago ( I guessed 3months ago ). I was gamble free for 4 months! Feel really good and get back my life again.

But you guys all know, the urge is always there, it is like a seed in the land which needs some water to grow. Today I got 1.2k$ in my bank account, feeling so lonely and bored, so I decided to watch some random football match. Suddenly I felt the high urge of gambling so I dep in 200$ and told myself that I just gamble for fun! That money went quickly! I was furious so dep the rest to go to the Evolution bacarat on Stake! Hell no just 6mins later a notification of “balance is low, please depositing”! 

Feeling really sad right now. I could have used that money to pay my debt, but I made wrong decision! 

I posted here to share my feelings and send my warning to you guys: never be too confident of yourself that you can control yourself when gambling! You and I can not control ourselves! We need to stop!

"Smoked my salary the day i got it, for the 7th time this year. in a row. On crypto.","Female 21 here

Its genuinely unbearable and im having massive suicidal thoughts.

I dont gamble the usual way - im addicted to crypto leverages (futures)

For those that dont know, you basically set a leverage (i obviously always go for extreme risky ones) on a crypto aka a multiplier, lets say of 30. each time a crypto does x2, you get 30 times your investment. x3 for 10% etc.

But the catch is obviously the liquidation price. I gamble on Kucoin. For a leverage of 30, the liquidation price can be like around 3% down from your entering price.

Its absolutely terrible because you can get liquidated in the blink of an eye with volatility.

I may win big but i lost so much that everytime i do i keep going in hopes to recover my total losses, and of course the vicious circle starts there. I lost my girlfriend from it because she noticed by looking at my phone many times.

I lost around 25k in two years. all my savings. since months ive been taking out 300 euros in cash out of my 1500 salary to make sure i dont indebt myself any more than my two current loansand at least pay my necessities.

It always starts the same way: ""fuck im having urges. okay ill just try with a smaller amount than usual, lets say 300 and be fucking lucky for once""

Then one hour later im down to 150. ""Fuck, im so close to liquidation price and i just cant take the loss it lost 2% in 30m it can gain 4% in an hour right?"" So i deposit more money to cover up for the potential liquidation.

Guess what: massive dip follows up, i get liquidated. so i put more in order to recover. guess what: i dont.

Its been like this for a year and a half and since 7 months its been happening the DAY of receiving my salary.

In march i went as fucking far as being an escort girl 3 times to not make my secondary bank freak out because of my loan. Loan that i took because of my fucking addiction.

Ive been ghosting them, im 4 months behind and theyve been threatening me a ton.

I still live with my mother and nobody beside my ex knows whats happening to me. My father committed suicide due to those exact problems a few years ago and shes traumatized by it. i cant tell her.

I genuinely dont know what to do anymore. im here buying stuff online when i get my salary then canceling or returning it 3 days later cuz ive hit negative balance. I feel like im gone completely insane from all of this so i really needed to rant about it.

All of this hiding from everybody, making up excuses with friends when i cant fucking afford my part of our ubereats or whatever, having them ask how am i broke if im working and living with my mom and having to ignore or make up something, the crushing guilt of knowing that youll get threatened and be living off rice and pastas for the next 4 weeks, being unable to buy your subway tickets so having to beg somebody for one, getting fined at times because you didnt pay your train ticket because you couldnt afford it... and so on and so on

Unbearable. Fuck. Gambling. Fuck. Crypto.

Day 486,"Everyday you choose to abstain from gambling is considered a win. Recovery is not one size fits alls. Everyone’s recovery is going to look different. Do what works for you, don’t do what doesn’t. Find out your triggers, replace them with good habits or hobbies. Talk to others going through similar issues. Build or join a community of humans ( I say humans because we make mistakes, we’re not perfect, nor should we try to be. If anything we should try to be better than we were the day before). Seek out professional help with therapists, specifically gambling addiction specialist. If sports are a trigger, find something more productive to do than sitting around on your phone, watching sports.

I feel like I’m losing control over my gambling habits (again),"I’ll preface this by saying that I’ve actually been up overall the past couple days, in the last few sessions I’ve had. I got cleaned once but out of those 3-4 times I’ve been this week, I’ve managed to walk out with some decent profit each time. It’s more so the habit of going every day and having that irresistible urge that I’m worried about. I used to gamble myself in debt, until just under a year ago. I could never keep any money in my accounts, my cards were maxed, and I was always broke. I was able to break out of that mentality, Ive paid off my gambling related debts, and I even have some investments in stocks. I never thought I would be able to have any amount of money without gambling it away for the longest time, and when I was finally able to save up money, it was the biggest relief. But like I said, these past few days, I feel like I’ve been falling back into that, even though I’ve been up in total. I know that’s not how this works, and if I keep going, I’m gonna lose all that profit and then some. I think I can reel it in, but there is that part of me that’s worried about what happens if I can’t. I already know how it feels to wanna gamble every cent you don’t even have. Ofc the wins have actually made it worse because I’m now going to correlate the casino with dopamine. And I’ve honestly been needing some of that in my life, it’s been tough to find things to look forward to lately, so going to the casino provides that dopamine for a little bit of time (until I lose ofc). I wish I could but I can’t go to the casino every day like I want to, it’s just a matter of am I strong enough to have control over it or am I gonna cave and revert to the way it used to be…",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1f9bu81/i_feel_like_im_losing_control_over_my_gambling/,3,2,1725503860,
Day one gamble free,"This is the first day in probably months that I haven’t placed a bet. I’m addicted to online gambling, slots specifically. 
About a month and a half ago I had a streak where I just kept winning and winning, hitting 1000x multipliers every 10th bonus game and it felt like I couldn’t lose, at the time I knew this was really really bad but still, it feels good to win. 
I managed to liberate a lot of that money but over the course of the last month and a half I probably gave double or triple what I won back and I’ve been in a manic state trying to chase that high ever since and obviously not succeeding… until today. 
Because of an issue with payroll at my work I won’t get paid until next week and I’m flat broke until then which turns out to be a good thing as I haven’t gambled today and while I’ve been itching to do it, I’m glad I haven’t been able to. 
I worked on my art, spent time with my family without any distractions, took my dog for a long walk and had some meaningful conversations with my partner… It felt really good, like I had my old life back for a brief period.
I hope I can keep it up and I don’t find a way to get a hold of some cash between now and next Thursday. 
I just want this nightmare to end. 
Most People who don’t have this issue look at you like you’re crazy, like “why don’t you just not do it” if it were that easy I wouldn’t but it’s like my brain is broken and it won’t do what I want it to do, luckily my wife is very understanding and supportive, but it feels like I have no control. 
Anyway, I wanted to jump on here and share my very minor success… Hopefully today is the first day of my recovery and hopefully anyone else struggling with this is making some progress fighting back the demon that is problem gambling as well but who knows, I’ve had hundreds of false starts since this became an issue two and a half years ago… I hope things the beginning of the end for me.

Gambling Addiction (Seeking Advice),"I'm writing this post today with a heavy heart...if you are in this group then you already know how fucked up this addiction is. Today is the day that I finally acknowledge how toxic and evil online gambling is.

I'm 22 years old and have lost over 200k in the last 4 months on stake. I was never really into gambling until 2022 (when I was 20) and I started because I saw some friends come up off it. Things got really bad for me in 2023 and by the end of the year I was down 40-50k and had credit card debt/taxes debt too. I stopped playing for awhile and things were getting better for me. I started paying off debts and had some money saved too. Fast forward to May of this year and I finally made back what I had originally lost and some profits as well. The come up was around 150k so I was out of debt and in profit around 100k too. God finally blessed me after years of pain and praying but this huge win was a curse just as much as it was a blessing because at this point, I still hadn't accepted the fact that I have a gambling problem.

Fast forward to today, I have lost all of the profit from the original win of 100k and then another 100k from my savings as well. I feel ashamed, depressed, hopeless and it's all because of gambling. I still consider myself fortunate as I have read some of the other posts in this reddit group and at least I'm finally ready to admit that I have a problem and ready to change my life for the better before it's too late. It's truly such a fucked up feeling when you lose money then deposit more to make it back, just to lose it again. I have been stuck in this win/lose/chase/lose again cycle since May and I'm done with it. If anyone wants to talk or has any insights about quitting and never looking back feel free to dm me. I'm glad that I found this group because I was feeling alone and didn't think that anyone would have similar experiences that I have or at least not to the same extent (6 figure losses) but after reading some of the posts on here, there are alot of people who do and it would be nice to talk to people who have or are currently going through a similar situation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1f96fac/gambling_addiction_seeking_advice/,4,5,1725488514,

My first day ,"Hey all,

My name is Murph and I have come to accept that I have a gambling addiction. I’m fortunate to be catching it early enough.

Over the past few months it started by putting in 20 bucks every pay check into stake, then that turned into every other day,  bartering with “well I can just use my next check to cover the cost”. Boredom is consistent at my job, isolating for 30-minutes turned into 2-3 hours. It’s way more fun to gamble than sit and do boring office work. I completely rationalize my gambling habits as justified for all the hard work I do. 

It came to a head after my next 2 big wins. $900, then $800, and $1400 huge wins. I was down $1200 and I fulfilled every gamblers dream of breaking even and more.

I cashed out $2200 and I was $1000 up and even had $1000 left over for myself after. I had money leftover to play all the blackjack I’d want for fun! This can last me forever! I even told my wife I’ll buy her that no bookshelf she wanted!

I lost that $1000 within the day. The next morning, I began the chase “I’ll just deposit $100 and hit big again and be back up and cash it. Yes, that’s what I’ll do.” $100, after $100, after $100. I sank deeper into the whole. Within a span of 2 days I lost the $1000 I had stashed in Stake and $1000 in my account. 

I put a “break in play” on my account as I scared the hell out of myself “Who am I?” I spent a few more days no gambling, then I fell back into my old routine “Next best Stake alternative” and I proceeded to find another casino to pursue my thrill of blackjack and slots. 

It was up until yesterday’s chase, I spent $500 within that day and this past weekend I chased for another $300. 

I do not like who I am becoming. I am fortunate to be in therapy but I have been shameful to admit my gambling problem. Today marks the day I get help from my support group while I still have my savings, a job to help me recover the losses, and to begin my recovery. 

I hate what these casinos do to you and I hate casinos.

I think when I used to gamble my mind was so fixated on betting so I never thought about it but since I quit it’s been on my mind a lot. Since I never had money or really time due to gambling I lost more or less most of my friends. Right now I’m at my parents house pursuing a degree from a school but I just really feel trapped. Currently also not working because I don’t feel like there’s a point. Luckily no real feelings to gamble because I know it won’t fix anything but I really just feel sad. I feel like I never treated my friends poorly other than not having that much time to hang, but perhaps that’s the definition of a bad friend. Not really sure what I even wanted to say anyways

I got an email today from a casino I used to play at saying my self exclusion had expired. I immediately opened up the site to renew the self exclusion, but I hovered over the confirm button for a good 30 seconds figuring out if it was okay to have a little punt.

Luckily I clicked confirm and removed access, but man that little blip in my brain letting me know it would be okay to just have a go really hasn't gone away.

I wrote this article a few weeks ago about the difference between addiction and recovery.

**Success through abstinence**  
Abstinence involves the complete cessation of all gambling activities and is often seen as the first and most essential step in the recovery process. Achieving success in abstinence is characterized by an individual's ability to stop gambling entirely, avoiding triggers and environments associated with their addiction. This may involve practical measures such as enrolling in self-exclusion schemes, steering clear of casinos and gambling websites, and staying away from gambling-related discussions or content.

**Success through recovery**  
Recovery, however, is a broader and more comprehensive process that goes beyond simply stopping gambling. It involves addressing the root causes and impacts of addiction, encompassing psychological, emotional, and social factors. While abstinence is a critical component of recovery, true success in recovery is marked by a more extensive transformation in the individual's life.

Almost 3 months clean,"Coming up on 3 months clean, turning 20 this month and lost around 1300 the night I decided to call it quits.

Banned online for 5 years, been around gambling with friends chatting and showing their bets but stayed true to my promise and not went back. Got a nice little amount in savings I luckily didn't blow and managed to make the money back I lost in around a month or two. 

Continuing to build my savings and hopefully have enough for a house deposit in the next 5 years or so.

No more stress constantly thinking of gambling in the back of my head. No more depressed nights and mornings. No more budgeting to make it to payday on £100.

Not thinking of my losses really at all anymore, put it behind me and focusing on the future.

Closing in on one year.,"Feeling better, no urges just shame. I have had time to reflect and see how my circumstances made me think that what I did was okay. I was alone, money on hand and recently lost my job and leverage trading hypnotized me enough to make it feel not only like an escape but an answer to all my problems. Total loss close to 40.000 euro's probably. In that time I found out that even if you win, it's designed to make you lose. The fees, taxes, stress and inevitable losses are not worth it. My wins became less frequent as panic set in, I was never going to climbed out of the hole I dug and small bets slowly scaled up to thousands at a time.

What finally solved my problems was giving financial control to my father, getting a job I actually want to wake up and work hard for. I found a supportive girlfriend and share my feelings and slowly save 1000 euro's a month to build my future. I still give myself a weekly allowance to do things I wouldn't before, having had nothing changed my perspective entirely.

It's slow and boring, but it's safe and smart. I check here almost every day to keep myself in check. I'm not sure why I decided to post but I know people are out there reading this with that horrible feeling in their stomache feeling like they have no choice but to go down the spiral.

Forgive Yourself,"I'm a little past the year marker in terms of putting money into my self-destructive gambling habit. It's weird, in a way, because I feel I've made little progress, but it really is something. I'll never get back that money, and it'll likely take decades to get back to similar financial condition I was in before. There will definitely be a scar in my psyche for the rest of my life as well. 

But, little by little, I'm forgiving myself. Forgiveness is so important, in my opinion, to heal and reduce the likelihood I fall back into those habits in the future. 

Something else that's helped me a bit has been to gradually open up to people I'm close with about my gambling struggles. It means a lot when a friend reminds me of the progress I've made because they know some of my journey. 

It's a long, long journey. It's not easy, and there is likely not going to be a sudden coalescing into feeling okay. But that, itself, is okay.

The game is rigged,"How do you think MGM or all the other big casinos pay for everything they own, buildings, employees, machines, luxury, hotels..

Its all been paid by gamblers. The edge is too big. The house ALWAYS win. If you win its just a loan theyre giving to you until you comeback.

You gotta understand how every fucking game is mostly designed for you to wager as much money as posible so they can rake in their house edge.

Slots are the best example, those mfs will pay you 5-50% of your bet and make it look like if youre winning, music and flashlights will appear, meanwhile they keep raking their 3-20% per spin (depending on slot rtp %(return to player)).

At some point one must just accept that this empire was not built upon winners and that playing the game means you can end up being another corpse in their walls.

Tens of thousands got ruined by live casinos in the past. One can just imagine how its going now with online casinos.

Being able to play 24/7. Infinite amount of games to choose from. More sophisticated games that exploit even more the human brain to hook him until he has nothing left but regret.

You cannot win. You most likely cant make what you lost back. That is how this works.

Once you accept that reality you should remember it everytime u get an urge.

Do you want to give more money to that human garbage who exploits people like us with addictions?

Youre literally giving the time god gave you and you used to make money to pay for you life expenses to those devils. Literally like selling your soul.

And I know it well, been here since i was 13, they got me young. Exploited my mental illness with their tricks.

But at some point you will see how pointless it is to keep engaging with it.

"Options and futures gamblers, can we ever trade again?","
I'm clean 4 months after having my entire life revolve around day trading for 2 years. It started off fine, but I had a large loss that made me desperate to win it all back, which led to gambling. Less and less money led to riskier and riskier moves until I had nothing left. 

I traded with a group of professional day traders who had a very regimented way to trade - I want to clarify that these were older men in the finance industry, not some random kids on Twitter with a paid Discord server. I did great trading with them until that loss that led me to gamble. 

My question is, do you think I could ever go back to trading that regimented method again, or am I ruined for life?

Tiktok sports cards gambling,"Posted this in the card hobby forum but thought it would be interesting to get perspectives in here aswell.

So about 6 months ago I started buying into sports breaks on Tiktok, at first it was a bit of fun and I enjoyed it but recently I've sat back and taken stock on what I've spent and what I've actually gotten in return. I've probably spent over £5000 easily on breaks and all I have to show for it is a few half decent cards (around the £50 mark) and a huge pile of toploaded cards worth nothing clogging up my room. I got massively caught up in the buzz of the ""chase"" and the possibility that I might hit a big card or a 1/1 worth thousands! Of course the reality is this never happened and I never actually hit anything. It's only now I realise that I probably was addicted to the buzz of the ""chase"" much like a problem gambler. 

The main breaker I used on tiktok was Onyx breaks, who gets in the ballpark of the numbers backyardbreaks do in the UK, so pretty big! No hate towards him at all but in his streams he always says things like ""you've got your spot back"", ""your paid"" or ""let's check comps to see how much that cards worth"". If people aren't buying quickly enough, the classic move is always the same, go online and show the massive hits from the product that you could get like the 1/1 and big Autos which drives people to buy in and of course never pops out of the packs. It's only now I look back on this experience I realise that the whole thing is about the possibility to make money. I think this is a massive issue especially the amount of kids on Tiktok and how unregulated it is, but that's another issue (other tiktokers such as epicbreaks getting an honourable mention). There are some breakers where it seems like money is not the driving force and the focus is more on the hobby and the cool cards pulled however they are few and far between. Even when I did occasionally get a card worth my spot back (which was very rare), I didn't want it as it wasn't what I was interested in collecting anyway.

I have had had a gambling problem in the past and have an extremely addictive personality and didn't twig that all I was doing was gambling until I look back on it because it feels so harmless at the time and that you are investing in collectibles.

These are just my thoughts on my experience on what seems to be a massive backdoor to gambling instead of what the hobby is for and certain individuals need to take more responsibility in my opinion as to the language they are using. The certain breaker I mentioned probably clears £2000 a night on breaks which all props to them but I think this could become a massive issue in regards to unregulated gambling. 

Interesting to hear your guys thoughts on it are and whether you've had an issue with this or not.

I can’t stop gambling. Borderline suicidal ,"I’m 100K in debt and I’m 23. I have just thrown away a fairly succesful business and owe creditors $8000. I have had a problem with gambling since I was 18 that’s has been on and off. I dropped out of university because of gambling, I didn’t get my license because of gambling and now I’m overseas getting stock for my business that my parents rely on to live and have blown every last every cent. $30 000 in total. It’s the biggest scam there is & I know the ammount of money I’ve lost is never coming back. How it is legal is baffling to me and how it is so promoted shouldn’t be allowed. My YouTube feed is just gambling even after I have asked not to be recommended this type of content, I have blocked almost all gambling streams and still my YouTube feed is filled with it. I understand how bad and evil the industry is but for the life of my I can’t stop. It’s an itch that takes over me and completely blinds me from the consuquences that will follow. I’m not sure if I’m more predisposed to it. My mom is a gambling addict as well as my uncle & my brother just blew his college tuition gambling. 

I have no idea what to do now and how I am going to get the $8000 that I owe. I have no degree, am living such a unhealthy lifestyle and have lost all my confidence. Life honestly feels like hell. I have become so desensitised and honestly feel dead inside.

667 days gratefully without a bet ,"Today:

I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

I am grateful for this vacation to the UK. It is coming to its end, this is always the way it is.

I am grateful that we got to the airport in one piece and are able to relax before our flight.

I am grateful that though I know I have a lot of work to do upon my return, I know it will be dealt with at the appropriate time. There is no use dwelling on it now. 

I am grateful to let things be as they are as best I can. The more I do this, the more peaceful I feel inside.

I am grateful that I’m learning each day how to handle situations, including when not to jump in and make things more complicated and difficult.

I am grateful that I’ve seen through this vacation that my son’s desire to become more independent is really high, and his confusion about how to be manifests itself in stubbornness and isolation. That feels awfully familiar to me! 

I am grateful that now and throughout the flight I will focus on my breath, be patient, watch my mind, relax, and try to let things go, one at a time. 

I am grateful for GA and the spiritual traditions that have changed the direction of my life towards serenity and peace. Each day, I choose to focus on not going back to my old life by placing that next bet. That’s good enough for me.

Day 28 - Long Read but Feeling Great,"August has been an extremely long and emotional month for me. But after months of gambling all my money away, I feel like its been one of my most progressive months.

My girlfriend found out about my gambling and basically gave me an ultimatum, its either her or the gambling. My friends found out about my gambling and haven't been very supportive at all – they heard rumours that I wasn't doing good mentally and when I told them about my gambling and how severe it was all they could do was laugh at me and roast me - this was Aug 21^(st) and none of them have checked in with me since (some friends they are). But despite it all, I feel like I have made a lot of progress…

Although there is a lot of debt to pay, I haven't gambled for a total of 28 days... wow! I know that doesn't sound like a long time, but I was literally at rock bottom at the beginning of August. Constantly breaking down, crying, feeling sorry for myself and just thinking about how dumb I was for putting myself in this position. I genuinely couldn’t see a way out. So I decided to quit both gambling and weed at the same time and move forward with my life. I don't want to speak too early but, I feel like this was the best decision I could've ever made. My mood feels so much better, I don't feel as lazy, I feel sharper mentally, the brain fog has gone and I don't feel the cravings. Ultimately, I still feel horrible for being in the position I am but, I can't let the past drag me down. I fucked up, I made mistakes but its how we bounce back from them!

Please my fellow redditors don’t give up hope!! I promise you; you can do this. Take it one day at a time and fight for your life. We are better than this people. The only way you can fight that mental disease is by building good habits and shouting louder than the demons in our head.

It has taken me a while to come to terms with my situation, I'm going to have a lot of hard months ahead. But, I've been offered a second job (weekend work) and I am going to work harder than ever to get my debts cleared off. As long as I have the love and support from my girl and my family, I can achieve anything. You can too! The financial problems we are suffering are a symptom of the gambling. If you can kill the gambling, the finances look after themselves. I know 28 days isn't much to brag about but if I, a degenerate gambler who has taken money from friends, family, loan etc. and gambled it away, can do it – then you can too. We can't be victims of this any longer.

 My phone literally broke yesterday... and I don't even feel mad about it. If it happened at the beginning of August I probably would've had a mental breakdown and scream thinking the world isn't fair lol!

Thinking you have it under control ,"I just want to tell my story about gambling with some of you people who may of been in a similar situation as I was, I've always enjoyed gambling even as a kid me and my family would take trips down to massachusetts  see family and my uncle would give me money to run across the street and get scratchtickets for all of us. I was only about 13 at the time but I vividly remember those moments it was always so much fun especially as a kid winning 20$ was a big deal.... 

But back then it wasn't a issue I mean I was only a kid and only did that with my family in mass a couple times a year but around high school junior-senior year I got into crypto I was working at JC Penny at the time making maybe 10-12$ a hour I tried getting into trading bitcoin and other useless crypto coins I probably lost around a couple grand before I gave that up for good. 

then came the time i moved down to Massachusetts in 2017 after I graduated high school for a job that my sisters bf got me it was a decent job i was making about 25$ a hour to start which was decent for being 18 years old and living with your uncle paying 500$ a month in rent. At this time I wasn't gambling with crypto or anything else I was just working and saving some money.... then a few months into me working somehow I figured out you could gamble at 18 years old at twin rivers casino in rhode island and this is around the time i really started to have a problem gambling Literally from the ages of 18-22 I would essentially spend every dime I made at this casino every weekend of course some nights I won but of course as you all know it all ends up going back into the casinos hands...... Now for whatever reason in my head I never had a problem with this because #1 all of my bills are paid still, and #2 I absolutely refused to ever gamble on credit/loans so whatever money i lost i could technically ""afford"" to lose.....

  
Now I eventually stopped going to the casino around 2 years ago in about 2022 as I was disgusted with how much money i've spent gambling and tried quitting for good. At this time i was making around 40$ a hour still living with my uncle and had just about no debt. And everything was good for a couple months I didn't go to the casinos at all and was finally saving money again not blowing every dollar i made to the casino....

  
I'd say at about the start of 2023 my friend introduced me to this website called stake and within just a few mere weeks i'd blown through all of my savings I had and started gambling every week again on payday.... right back in that vicious cycle and around this time I was making about 50$ a hour so I was at about 100K a year more if you include the overtime we work, So this goes on for a couple months now were in middle of 2023 Still gambling every single week, and one random day I blew all my gambling money already for the week so I started to look up sweepstake casinos that would take CC payments (Hands down the dumbest mistake of my life) Finally found 1 and decided to do a measly 200$ deposit as I told myself i would never gamble on credit and this was a 1 time thing, well as you all know how compulsive gamblers work within just a week or so I'd maxed out all 3 of my cards totalling around 15K$ dollars I was devastated Told myself that this was a line i'd never cross and I have to stop. So what I did was take out a personal loan to pay off all my cc debt which would save me $ as the interest rate was much lower.

Now From that point middle of 2023 to I'd say 2024 I didn't gamble much I occasionally on payday would spend maybe 200$ and then either profit a little bit or just stop after 1 deposit. 

  
Now this Is where everything gets really bad start of 2024 I start gambling heavy again blowing most of my paychecks to stake and being miserable but hey my loans and rents/bills are paid so it is what it is. But one random week Just Like last time I ran out of money for the week and told myself I was just going to make 1 small deposit on my credit card and make some money and stop.... well just like last time I lost within 5 minutes and kept depositing and Maxxed out my credit cards again So now i'm around 27K in debt about 13K from my loan and 15K from my credit cards AGAIN. I was absolutely crushed by this feeling knowing i just set my life so far back and made the same mistake AGAIN.... So I quit gambling again telling myself this is it and I can't keep on living like this anymore.....



flash forward to a month ago im doing okay trying to pay off my bills and not gamble which I was doing good at I figured I could maybe have one of my family friends lend me 13K to pay off my credit cards and save money with the interest being so much lower... Long story short I got the money and paid off my credit card debt again but still being about 25K in debt. Now I truly don't know what the actual fuck is wrong with my brain but I had a 2nd chance at doing the right thing and I fucked it all up AGAIN right before I started to type this I just maxxed out all of my cards again for the 3rd time.... just feeling so fucking hopeless I don't  even know what to do anymore.... I just hope If any young people see this post they don't make the same mistakes I did you don't want to go down this deep dark road like I have to.



  
TLDR: just maxxed out my credit cards for the 3rd time about 40k in debt from gambling don't know what to do anymore. think my brains broken beyond repair",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1f5yl83/thinking_you_have_it_under_control/,6,4,1725141227,

I was doing so good..... ,"Man oh man..

I was doing so good, I thought I kicked the can for real. I made a few bets because I was doing a small challenge using left over money I won from a bet ( I withdrew my deposit and some) two weeks of a nice ladder challenge. I end up losing it and started rage betting. VIRTUAL BLACKJACK.. F******* disgusting, and I kept rage betting and depositing and went down about 1200-1400 in probably 1-2 hours easily. I now find myself trying to deposit more and chase and chase and I am spiraling now. I can't believe the chokehold this stupid stupid stupid thing has on me, it's become nothing to lose money. Just in july I did the same thing and swore I wouldn't ever again but here I am. I feel like a dumbass, it's not even about the money but more this drained feeling of just worthlessness and like I am setting myself back over and over with this addiction thinking i'm going to get lucky once and quit. I can't believe how dumb I am to even play Video Blackjack. I have finally excluded myself from all this nonsense, 

I am sorry to the ones who I reached out to and commented on your posts with advice / words of encouragement as I have let you all down. I genuinely feel empty. I know the $$ amount isn't a lot but it adds up over this year and this addiction is unlike anything else i've faced. I am 24/yo and it's crazy how so young I feel so defeated over something so dumb. I tell others what I should be doing for myself, it really is easy to say but hard to do. I need to find joy in life again, this year has been awful, bottom of the barrel awful. I can't believe I am so dumb. This with trying to find a new job, it's just been tough. I hope we all reach a new light one way or another and realize the disease this really is. The money sucks but the mental aspect of it all is far worse. 

It's so accessible. Open my phone, transfer and within 1-3 minutes I can be gambling it all. F*** ... I am extremely disappointed I did it again. I hope one day to look back and see this as one big lesson for a bigger picture. I will be more active here or try to be as I was at my best when trying to help others. 

The worse part about it is if anyone ever asks I just say i'm fine, ""you haven't ate today"". I'm fine. ""you seem upset"" I'm fine. It's f***** embarrassing that this has a chokehold on me like it does. I never would've thought. 

Hope you all have a blessed day, and thank you to the ones always spreading hope and positivity here when you can. I'm sure you all have saved lives of people you wouldn't even recognize if they were standing right beside you.

Day 263: I will never miss wasting entire weekends gambling ,"I have had many weekends chasing losses where come Monday it felt like I never had time off at all. 

It may have started innocent enough with that first Saturday early game looking for that quick adreline rush. Then that lost. Then the doubling and tripling up, then the in-game wagers to recoup part of the losses.

Then rinse and repeat Sunday. 

So while others feel rejuvenated, refreshed and motivated to start the week, my self abuse would leave me tired, stressed and moody, with a long week ahead. 

Money aside, consider the long term cost of this to your physical and mental health, your work and personal relationships, and your motivation. 

If this continued long term how could I be focused and productive at work? I would be the employee there in body not in spirit, who does the minimum to avoid getting fired. 

Instead of the person I want to be who connects with colleagues, earns raises and bonuses, and advances in his career.

Don't care about upcoming NCAAF and NFL Season and it's just a wonderful feeling!,"After years of up and down sports gambling I put myself on the 5-year self-exclusion list. It has honestly been the best decision I've made in a long time. It's opened my eyes to what really went on for years. Now, I just sit down to watch sports as a fan. No longer have to worry about spreads or over/unders. 

I've noticed a serious mental and physical switch has been turned. I've started exercising more (already have lost 15 pounds from not sitting in front of a PC or TV every night). My wife and I have booked our dream Caribbean vacation in November...That would have been unheard of years ago. I have no desire to ever do it again and that was just the push that was needed.

Day 482,"Hope everyone is having a great gamble-free weekend! Football is back this weekend and for us compulsive sports gamblers, this time of year could be triggering for us.  It's easy to say find alternatives when all we want to do is sit on the couch, phone in hand watching football 12 + hours a day, but sometimes, out of sight, out of mind works.  Get outside and get some vitamin D, spend time with loved ones, put the phone down and away. Reach out to others going through similar issues as you are. Support is everything especially this time of the year for us.

His friends,"My partner has been a gambler for most of his life, since he was a teen. He is trying to stop and has self excluded, banned himself from online casinos, blocked his bank cards from allowing gambling transactions and entrusted me with most of our finances.

But now when he wants to gamble he borrows a tablet from a friend, logs into his friend's casino account and borrows money to pay for the gambling. Multiple friends have enabled him this way. Then he comes to me and asks me to pay back these people who have helped him gamble. I said no to one and that friendship, one which was longer than my partnership with my partner, has crumbled. My partner blames me, I think.

I've had a text message exchange with another friend politely asking him to stop but he said basically he is my partner's friend, not mine, so will do what my partner wants. 

I'm at a loss for what to do. If I don't pay them back, friends are lost. If I do, these friends keep helping my partner with his addiction, which is no help at all. My partner is a lovely person apart from his addiction and I think that's why his friends want to ""help"" him. He's known these people since he was young. Some also have their own addictions and occasionally when my partner has money he has given them some (to my irritation). 

I don't want to be the gatekeeper to his friendships but I don't think these friendships are good either. But who am I to judge others. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1f5k90w/his_friends/,6,5,1725100340,

"I literally hate everything about me, gambling is a disease and i can’t breathe anymore with gambling around me (Please, Speak to me guys, i’m alone in this. ","
I have posted here multiple times. I’m an addict. I’m a f*cking loser. I have been gambling for the past 6-7 years of my life. I’ve tried to quit, but I’ve never been able to get out of it. My childhood was so messed up. I went to a school where all my friends were rich, and I came from a middle-class family. My father is extremely frugal and never gave me any money. He never cared to give a single penny. All my life, I’ve asked him for money and never got anything, which has always frustrated me to no end.

I was always ashamed of the car we had, our house, everything. I started earning money when I was 16. I’ve earned around ₹1 crore (approximately $120,000) until now, which is a huge amount for someone my age. But what’s the point? I’ve used and thrown all my money into casinos, poker sites, and illegal live casinos. I’ve lost my girlfriend, my best friend, my brother. Everyone has lost trust in me. I’ve lost everything. Most importantly, I’ve lost my career.

I’m a professional musician with more than 1 billion streams across all platforms. Most people have heard my music, but what’s the point now?

I owe more than ₹20 lakhs (around $24,000) and have no income source. I’m completely off track with my music. I don’t understand why I am like this. I don’t understand why me. I’ve failed. I’ve always tried to be someone I’m not, and I suck at it. I’m a loser.

I’ve lied to my parents daily. I’ve lied to my partner daily. I just can’t stop gambling. Whatever amount comes into my bank account, I screw it up. Dude, I wish I was dead. I genuinely feel that way. When I was 18-20, I was completely depressed and out of touch with the world. From 20-24, I’ve just been gambling. I’ve earned so much money, but I guess my relationship with money is just so weird. I don’t feel any happiness when I receive money; I just feel the urge to gamble. I’ve failed. I’ve failed as a person. I genuinely need help, guys. Please talk to me. I just can’t talk to anybody; I feel so lonely and so depressed.

I have people coming to my house today to beat me up. I swore on my mom and i told mom that i don’t do gambling anymore and  I needed ₹20,000 and that I wasn’t gambling (she never gave me a single penny all my life, but she recently realized how bad my childhood was and started giving me money lately). I’ve lost all my friends. Everyone sees me as a loser, a gambler, and a sh*tty person.

My relationship with money has been so bad, so cruel. I just wish I was never born.

I GAMBLED TODAY AS WELL. My mom gave me money, which I asked for to pay my debtors. I ended up playing with it. I almost doubled it but still didn’t cash out. I ended up taking out the final loan, maxing out on cards, loans, and outside loans, and I’m losing literally everything.

I wish I was never born. I hate everything about myself. I’m a loser, depressed, wasted my career, wasted my life in music, and have a debt of more than $25,000 hanging over me.

I beg you guys to please talk to me. I’m losing myself. Please stay away from gambling; it’s the worst kind of drug, worse than any other addiction.

I spent most of it just reflecting how my life has be come this way and what I've got plans to tackle my gambling addiction.

It does come with debts which I have so my main focus was able to work towards clearing my debts I have a plan in place once I catch up on all my bills.

It's just difficult to think I did this to my self but I think 1 year I should be able to get rid of most my debt if I stick to my plan.

Most important for me is family has been supporting but it's has not been easy for them since I've lied multiple times about stopping I for once have never lied to my family until I've picked up gambling it's how much it has changed me.

I am apologize to them but I hope I can be better today Is Saturday I admit I had urges to go down to place a bet but I've got work I am writing this down so just as a reminder no more.

Relapsed after 3 months.,"Yes I was sober from casinos and online gambling for 3 months after hitting rock bottom again with an empty bank balance.

This evening I had a bad fight with my significant other and I couldn't just go to sleep in bed with them, it didn't feel right. I had such a strong urge to go to the casino.

It was 10pm and I was bored and couldn't think of anywhere else to go. I ended up losing my entire savings which was $2000 but then I had $12,000 of my significant others' money in my account because someone needed to send a payment to them and they sent to me instead. 

For the first time in my life, I gambled with money that wasn't mine. I remember shaking and feeling so nauseous at the ATM and telling myself not to do it but I just kept thinking what if I could win back my personal losses.

I ended up withdrawing $1000 of my significant others' money and lost it all. I can't describe how awful this feels. This is the lower than losing your entire bank balance. Being in debt to someone and stealing from them aswell. I don't know how I will tell them. I don't know whether to lie or tell the truth but regardless I'll pay them back in a few days hopefully.

Last time I hit rock bottom I was very self criticising and it made me have one of the worst panic attacks of my life. This time I'm going to try tell myself that relapse is a part of recovery and to forgive myself and learn lessons from this going forward.

Ngl bit rough last 12 hours, let myself watch some videos online of the games i used to play and im trying to tell myself how retarded those games are by watching it, not the best idea as i wake up confused and with the urge.

  
Thankfully the first thing i saw in the morning is my daughter. Her smiling, asking me what I will do today was enough. I snapped out of it. I would prob be in a dark place without her.

  
Highly reccomend to go see the ppl you love during the first days or when urges creep in, they should be one of the biggest reasons we are quitting and fighting our demons.

  
We cant let them down, we cannot exchange them and the love they have for us just for some stupid fix that will only bring us down, make us feel miserable, take all the money we have and leave us hopeless and destroyed.

  
I know it might not be easy but let me inspire you with one of the best quotes in the Lord of the Rings:

“Frodo: I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.

Gandalf: So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.

  
There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring. In which case, you were also meant to have it. And that is an encouraging thought.""

  
You have been given this battle because you are capable of defeating your demons and bring the light back into your life.

30 day gambling free! ,"I’m incredibly proud (and a bit surprised) to say that I’ve made it 30 days without gambling. If you had told me a month ago that I could do this, I probably wouldn’t have believed you. Gambling felt like it was part of my identity—something I could never give up. But I’m here to tell you that change is possible.

The Turning Point: Alan Carr’s Easy Way to Quit Gambling
The book that really made the difference for me was Alan Carr’s ""Easy Way to Quit Gambling."" It shifted my mindset completely. Instead of feeling like I was giving up something valuable, I began to see gambling for what it truly is—a trap. This shift in perspective was the key to breaking free.

The Struggles
I won’t lie; the journey hasn’t been easy. There were moments when I thought I couldn’t go on without the rush that gambling provided. I hit rock bottom more times than I can count—losing money I couldn’t afford to lose, feeling so mentally drained that I couldn’t sleep, and being physically broke. I remember those sleepless nights, filled with regret and anxiety, wondering how I’d ever get out of the mess I’d created.

My first Gamblers Anonymous (GA) meeting was a breaking point for me—I broke down completely. But that breakdown was the start of something new. It was the first time I allowed myself to feel the full weight of my addiction and realize that I couldn’t continue living this way.

What Helped Me Quit
Reminding Myself of the Pain: I kept reminding myself of how shitty I felt every time I lost—those sleepless nights, the constant anxiety, and the hopelessness. No more!
Focusing on Organic Money-Making: I started focusing on earning money in ways that felt authentic and fulfilling. This not only gave me a sense of accomplishment but also helped me rebuild my finances.
Loved Ones: I reconnected with my family and friends, who had always been there for me. Their support and the time I spent with them became my new source of joy.
Staying Busy with Games: I rediscovered my love for video games. They’re a fun way to keep my mind occupied, and unlike gambling, they don’t drain my wallet.
The Results
I can’t believe how much healthier I feel now—both mentally and physically. I’m more present, more engaged, and more at peace. The anxiety that used to plague me has diminished significantly, and I no longer feel the constant urge to gamble.

Final Thoughts
If you’re reading this and you feel like you’ll never be able to quit, I want you to know that you can. It’s not easy, but it’s absolutely worth it. Take it one day at a time, focus on the positives, and know that you’re not alone in this journey.

Invest In Your Health. Not Gambling.,"Reddit communities are great for those struggling with gambling addiction to vent their frustrations, which we all experience. They also offer a supportive space for people to share advice based on similar experiences.

But what’s next to get your life back on track?

I’m a 33-year-old man who battled a 15-year gambling addiction and have since switched careers to help others who are struggling. With lived experience in gambling addiction, I’m now pursuing my Master's in Psychology and working towards certifications in mental health to become a personal gambling addiction coach.

One thing I didn’t have when battling my addiction was a personal accountability coach to help me one-on-one. GA meetings were a good resource, and therapy helped, but that support didn’t come until it was almost too late.

I want to be your first step in gaining the confidence to seek help. Send me a DM if you’re looking for someone to hold you accountable while you fight this addiction. Don’t let it ruin your life. Get help ASAP. Gambling addiction is a worldwide problem, and we are just scratching the surface of the impact it will have on people’s lives.

Closure of the day,"Just a theory, hear me out.

I realized that I have difficulty ending a day. I just don’t want the day to end. 

Maybe it sterns from the same principle as the GA saying that most of us are unwilling to grow old and see gambling as a way to escape responsibility. Ending a day after all means getting older.

I always struggled to end a night out. I always wanted it to continue till forever. 

When I was still studying, I worked in the catering industry. I loved the job. Afterwards we always had a few drinks and had our own afterparty. I hated it when it ended. 

Gambling is an escape to continue the day. Until forever, thanks to 24/7 casino’s. The only way to end it is to lose all your money. And that’s the reason we sometimes want to lose. We get tired but aren’t able to walk away. We know we only would stand up and walk away if we lose it all. 

It’s the continuing of the dopamine supply. Our chemicals are fucked up. Ending the day means no more dopamine coming in. 

But remember kids; nothing good happens after 2 am.

***So when the clock strikes 2, just go home and go to sleep.*** 

Just go home after work. Just go home after the groceries. Just go home after dropping the kids off at school. Just go home after a few drinks with friends. Just go home after every obligation. 

Accept closing off the day. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1f4cncp/closure_of_the_day/,12,3,1724963366,
Help me please,"Hello everyone, I'm sorry if the message is long.

My life has been ruined because of the online casino.
I never thought I would write a message like this one day but it's been burning me inside for a while and I have no one to talk to..

I'm from France, I'm 20 years old, and it all started when I had a YouTube channel at 300K 3 years ago, I was 17 at that time and my life was just great, I was making a pretty good living. At that time I discovered the online casino with a friend who showed me this on discord..
I was a minor and I had created an account in my father's name, and the first time I played, I went from €50 to €400 at roulette and I lost everything in 30 minutes. Nothing dramatic then 1 month later I had a little click in my brain that encouraged me to play alone this time, I deposited 100€, then 100€ up to 5 times in a row because I wanted to recover my miracle bets that day, I went from 500€ to 14,000€ at blackjack. I have never been so lucky in my life..
I had stayed 48 hours in front of the screen (no joke) and in fact I just couldn't stop, automatically in my brain I said to myself ""I can surely go up to 20k, 25k now""
Until the drama, or I was very greedy. I had gone from 14k to 0€..

A big depression and a lesson for me followed, 1 month later, my Youtube channel was hacked. I saw the world collapse in front of me. I managed to get it back 3 months later, but I no longer had the motivation to do anything, I forced myself but I no longer had as many results. Until I finally gave up and sold my channel on Escrow.

From the age of 18 to 20. I started doing small jobs in factories, but each time the same scenario repeated itself.

I connected every month to play at the online casino with the savings I had + my salary. This little voice in my head told me that I could make a little more money, and obviously each time I put money online, either I went up and lost everything, or I lost everything and wanted to win back what I had lost, until I got into a vicious circle where I did nothing but get into debt. I lost a total of €35k out of my pocket.

It killed me in all aspects of my life, my mental state, my relationships, it was impossible for me to imagine working, it's so hard to have to earn 10€/h when the day before I was putting hands of 500€ in blackjack.

I decided to go to Australia when I was 19 all alone, leaving my family behind, just to have a bigger salary and save for my personal projects.
I had been working for 3 months in the territory, a small classic farm job, except that I had just been injured, and I had to make money at all costs, I was obsessed with money.
So I had a period where I couldn't do anything.. One evening I decided to play at the online casino again, I deposited $3,000 (my entire Australian account) and I made the biggest run of my life, $3k to $30k at blackjack, except that I lost everything 3 days later. Some will call me stupid, but at the time I felt like my brain was disconnected from reality. I wanted to be greedy and try to go up a little more. It was accompanied by a big depression, but this time on the other side of the world alone.

My mother paid for my return ticket even though she was not financially well.

I have never felt so guilty in my life, I would have done anything to make money but after all these efforts I find myself with €0 on my accounts with the impression that I shouldn't be where I am today.

When I returned to France I started smoking cannabis every morning, noon, and night, I had become addicted like crazy, but I managed to stop 2 months ago.

24 hours ago I lost the remaining €3,500 in my crypto account hoping to improve my situation slightly, and no I just got even deeper into it. I am at €0 on all my accounts, with exactly €8,500 in debt to my mother, people in my family, banks and institutions.

I see all the people my age having fun, living their lives, their relationships, going on vacation. Everyone seems so happy..

I am writing this text crying like shit, I have never suffered so much in my life, for the first time I have dark thoughts, I feel so stressed about the future, I want to do something serious, but I think of my mother who has always been there for me, and then me who has just fucked up, and failed in every aspect of my life.. On top of that my father who is an alcoholic who leaves the house whenever he feels like it, who comes back in horrible states, who misses work, with my mother who is sad all the time and who is sick.

I cry every fucking night in secret, I can't take it anymore..

What did you learn?,"Im on day 1. Been 24 hours. I feel ok. It hurts but im accepting what ive done and reminding me all the time that the only way i can ever see the money i lost back is the same way the money came in. Working hard.

  
Dont want to gamble, for what? I know what will happen, been there so many times in the past there is no more tricking/lying myself. Also there is no more ima bet just this as we all know thats how every bankrupt story starts.



Now my question for anyone reading is, what did you learn from your experience?

  
We must learn to make the pain we felt make sense, to make the hell we went through worth.

  
Its the only way to honor yourself and your family.

  
Learn from your mistakes once and for all.

  
Its all a scam, games rigged to the core, terrible odds and the ppl behind those online casinos are some of the most terrible human beings alive, you want to give them your hard earned money so they can pay for another hooker and some more coke?

  
It will take time, work, patience, selflove and a lot of strengh but its worth all of it if we can finally win the war against gambling.

  
See at the end of the day there is two different type of bills in life:

-The price of discipline 

-The price of regret

  
The second one outweights the first one by so much that its a no brainer which one we should pick.

  
You can do it anon, you just need to go for it with all you have and NEVER forget what you been through.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1f42ncl/what_did_you_learn/,5,4,1724938680,
Day 59 - Struggling the last 3 days,"I was feeling really great until Tuesday. My lease is up this weekend, me and my GF were planning on moving out to CO, I got permission to work 100% remote, she was going to find work out there. Even with my shit 590 credit score we secured two places, both nice homes for relatively affordable prices. Tuesday, I get a call on my work line, debt collector I had been pushing off. 

Told me they would be suing soon, I took the bait, chose to settle for 50% off the total. Needless to say, it does feel good to pay it off, but now I can't move, we have to move back to her parents.

Tough pill to swallow, and I think the reason it's affected me so much is because of the amount of $ I blew gambling and also my blown losses, knowing I could have paid my debt off the hundreds of times I blew multiple thousands, tens of thousands, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, MILLIONS, and had savings so we could move wherever we want.

I spoke to someone at GA last night about this, THIS is why I'm still sick, clouded with my prior mistakes. Once I start forgetting about those times and live in reality/accept my current situation, then I know I'll start to feel better.

I'm still early, I still got a way to go, but I must say the last 59 days have been 1,000,000 better than the 3 years prior. To anyone still gambling and lurking or constantly posting like I was before I committed to stopping, please just give it an honest try.

Day 479: have barriers in place,"Everyday you choose to abstain from gambling is considered a win. Recovery is not one size fits alls. Everyone’s recovery is going to look different. Do what works for you, don’t do what doesn’t. Find out your triggers, replace them with good habits or hobbies. Talk to others going through similar issues. Build or join a community of humans ( I say humans because we make mistakes, we’re not perfect, nor should we try to be. If anything we should try to be better than we were the day before). Seek out professional help with therapists, specifically gambling addiction specialist. If sports are a trigger, find something more productive to do than sitting around on your phone, watching sports.

There’s also variance which is another beast in itself but on top of that I will run up huge stacks then all of a sudden a “switch” will flip and I’ll just gamble it away. On top of that if I play the pit games I go into a “trance” and just keep playing more and more money.

It's really been hard for me to tell anyone that i have an addiction. I started freelancing around last year and got to over 100K php (1778 USD). Even with only this, I was way happier, brighter and was just enjoying life since its im happy with this amount of money. Just a few months ago, I started doing freelancing way more, and i got to over a 1,000,000 pesos. with this, i started gambling, i won over 300k with gambling but just yesterday i lost it all, now im back to only having 900k php. I feel like shit, I feel so pathetic, I feel that i've hit rock bottom. I was way happier and didn't care about money when I first started but now when i reached a million, i got too greedy and hated losing money. Even though i didnt lose everything that i had, i feel like that i've lost it all, that i can't get anything back. I feel as though, im in debt.

Still feel like a loser despite reasonable success. Striving for fulfillment. Day 35.,"Sorry this is a little bit of a vent, I've never told anyone about my gambling problems and how it's affected other areas of my life.

I had my rock bottom in mid july. Received a large commission check and squandered about half (8k) at the casino. Since then I've self excluded from the casino and removed all casino apps from my phone/laptop. Realistically I should probably start seeing a therapist too.

I've lost probably 100k lifetime (10 years) gambling through different avenues, and the total number is really eating away at me lately. Regardless, I'm still relatively financially stable. I'm 33, my house is paid off, only 1k in CC debt and about 15k on an auto loan, and I make over 100k with room to improve. 

But I still feel like a complete fucking loser. Honestly, the money aspect isn't even the worst part at this point. I've been single for several years now, most of my time and energy is spent working, working out or gambling. In the process I've isolated myself from a lot of friends and two wonderful women who probably would have married me if I wasn't such a shithead wrapped up in gambling. Thankfully I still have my family and several friends, but thinking about how self-centered I've been makes me sick to my stomach. 

It's just frustrating because before I was gambling, I was a jovial, light hearted, joking person who people liked to be around. I had way less money and was way less stressed out. Thinking about how those qualities have diminished throughout this journey is really eating away at me. It makes me feel like I'm unworthy of human connection. Seeing my friends start families and live the american dream while I'm by myself due to my neurotic and hedonistic ways.

I know what I need is more fulfillment in my life and to try and bring back those qualities I had with vigor, but it's going to take a long, consistent effort. All I know at this point is gambling robbed me of a lot of joy throughout these years and I'm having a very difficult time forgiving myself for how short-sighted I was.

Long relapse,"February start of this year, I was 3 months clean from gambling. I’m not gona lie those 3 months were really peaceful. Since then I’ve been relapsing every pay day, lost more than half of my pay during this time. Just today I lost another 1.3k.

Doubled down by clearing my account and again, left with $0. Only enough left to pay for fuel and the basics until I get my next pay. 

I just feel so empty. I see my friends buying new cars and houses and I’m happy for them. But it just feels painful knowing I could’ve been doing the same instead of gambling 50,000 over the last 2-3 years (nearly every dollar saved during my uni jobs). 

I’ve been able to go 9 months before without gambling - but it’s near impossible to survive the first week every time I try. I’d like to believe I can get there again one day. 

Until then, I just wanted to write this out. It’s not something I feel I’m able to discuss with friends or family. They know I’ve gambled a lot, but not just how bad it is. I’m ashamed, guilty and just wanted to let it out. Trying my hardest from here on in, but I know just how tough it is.

Price of gambling vs price of recovery.,"As you gamble you accept or not, but will inevitably become a lier, manipulator, narcissic, egocentric, thief and emotionally you’ll deceive, live in misery, isolation, self destruction, extemly low self-esteem and in depression. By gambling you accept to harm those around you and to bring absolute misery into their lives. Ultimate price of gambling is your health, followed by anticipated death.

As you decide to help yourself and start recovering the price you pay for the first 50 to 100 or 150 days ( depends on many factors ) is numbness, meaningless in life, very low to extrem depressed mood, a life free from joy, an enormous amount of regrets, depression, boredom, sleep depravation, anxiety to the roof as long with stress. 

BUT. as days goes by, those emotions fade away slowly but surely, your resiliency will pay as your brain needs that to addapt itself to the new lifestyle you’ve chosen for yourself (gambling-free).
And through time you find yourself back. The values you cherished, the hobbies you’ve had, and humbled by that experience, a greater love for Life. 

the main difference is that the first one in not by choice, and we nurturing a vicious cycle. That will be stopped only through death. 

The second however is a choice and you are nurturing a vertuous cycle that will never break as, in many aspects, the outcome is Life. 

Harsh truth : We are fucked up in both cases. that why there’s a 90%+ fail ratio on first recovery attempt. Many are willing to quit but are not willing to pay then price it takes. 
And most likely it’s already too late when one commit to pay any price to recover. 

As a side note, you’d be a fool to think that gambling is the source of all your problem. And that recovering from gambling would solve everything. Gambling only put all your problems on steroides, it amplifies them. Recovering from gambling will enable you to deal with it in serenity and forcibly overcome it in a more graceful manner than how you would as a gambler.

on May 13th to 14th 2024, After relapsing countless times after chasing losses, after thinking i somehow had an infinte money glitch and losing all i had and begging and crying and depression and self-hatred i was at breaking point.  I sold my office laptop worth about $800 at about $150. Sold everything i had and was sleeping on the floor in my mothers house. After losing that money on the 13th as i was going back home on a motrocycle taxi (boda boda) i confessed to rider who was an old man i had known from my university. I told him all my struggles, my depression and he told me to accept Jesus and that He will pray for me i was a degenerate that used my transport money for gambling and made my own mother pay for me the bike ride.

On the 14th i stole a JBL speaker cheaply and i had my own sisters broken laptop in my bag. After losing the money of the speaker and getting even and losing it again like 7 times i was going insane. My family had told me if it ever happens again then i was going to jail or being shot(i think they were joking). A few weeks before, my uncle who is a soldier slapped me and my mum hit me for being soo heartless. I had been accused of stealing laptops at my fathers house (they were found later and i wasnt involved), A gold watch and sunglasses from my mothers place (it was found later when i moved out but the damage was done).

I was at the end of my rope my small $9.5 button phone was on low and none of the people i usually called would pick up or help. but i was fed up and stressed and i spoke to Jesus kind of annoyed but with desparation in my heart. ""God if you still have a plan for my life, let someone, anyone call me, otherwise i will most probably sell my sisters' laptop, drink alcohol(i dont drink and actually hate alcohol), and kill myself (in my heart i was thinking of sleeping with a prostitute as well)"" I know it is not right to talk to God like this but as i walked the 10 minute journey to the shop, i kept hearing voices in my head telling me ""God hates me"", ""God is a liar"" ""God doesnt care"", ""He has forgotten me,"" ""why am i in this mess if God cares?"" etc. I walked infront of a moving truck and wrestling with the voices in my head and with a lump in my throat i said ""God you are not a liar"".

When i reached the shop the man inspected it and because the motherboard was fired and he knew i was desperate, he offered me $15. Just as i was about to take the money with regrets in my heart. I had already forgotten the prayer i prayed, with my phone battery seconds or minutes away from going off my father calls me and tells me ""Son, i am leaving the office now, i am in town, a couple minutes away from your University, i am going on a trip upcountry, how much does your website cost?"" 

My mind was not expecting it. I knew God had given up on me so i told him i will meet him at home. When i turned to continue bargaining with the shopkeeper it clicked in my mind. ""This is your prayer being answered"". I ran as fast as i could outside that shop and told the shopkeeper ""My father has called me, im going away"".

I knew i would have to tell him the truth and come clean that once again i messed up. He had sent me to my mothers because i had stolen alot from home and got into fights with family over money. But this was not just my father. My earthly father calling me to save my life. This was Jesus. This was my Heavenly Father showing that He cares about me and still has a plan.

As it turns out i went with my dad and my sister on the trip about 500km away from the capital to a modest house he has been constructing in his hometown. I had my sisters' broken laptop in my laptop bag as it also looks like mine and was waiting for the right time to confess. 

During those moments i met my cousin brother who has always kept me in prayer for the two years i was a gambling addict. We prayed together but more importantly i got to read the Bible. When i read the Bible i found a scripture which is very common

# Jeremiah 29:11 New King James Version

^(11) For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.

# Matthew 7:7-11New King James Version

# Keep Asking, Seeking, Knocking

^(7) “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. ^(8) For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. ^(9) Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? ^(10) Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent? ^(11) If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him! 

If my earthly parents or mentors or friends or caregivers can never give me a stone if i ask for bread, if i myself can never give a child a snake if they ask me for a fish then why can't Jesus who actually loves you and me not help us? God is good. 

TL:DR I confessed, currently working off the debts i had in my bank accounts, I am defending my thesis next month(that is a nother story for another day as i dropped out of highschool from 2016 to 2020). My sister who was pissed off and my uncle helped me recover the laptop and speaker and told the shopkeeper to never work with me again  Because of the trauma and misstrust my sister thought i would go back to gambling after a month but here i am 109 days and counting.

Lost it all (again) while waiting to be self-excluded,"Lost like 20k in the past 2 years. Became addicted once a lot of online casinos popped up. Never would have thought I’d fall into the trap but here I am. 

Last week I submitted an application to be self excluded but it takes around 3 working days to be added to the list (it’s just how it works here, don’t think it’s the same in the US or other countries). Once on the list, I won’t be able to play in physical casinos nor online. 

I should be on the list tomorrow or the day after, so I thought why not play for the last time? Well, lost another grand, which I couldn’t really afford. I will dig myself out of this shit hole, but it just shows how devastating compulsive gambling is.

Nobody knows, I can’t imagine opening up and admitting to what I have done, I feel like my family wouldn’t look at me the same. We have one gambler in our family that has caused a lot of pain and damage, thankfully I didn’t go that far. But it’s harder to deal with it all alone. 

Wish me luck on the road to recovery. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1f24mxv/lost_it_all_again_while_waiting_to_be_selfexcluded/,3,2,1724720884,

70K in debt to 50K in savings over the course of a year and a half!,"This is not a post to brag about anything, as I would have over a million bucks probably if I never picked up this god awful addiction in the first place.

But if I can beat it, so can anyone.  I was so deep in, and at my worst took out a 40,000 loan and gambled it away.  Pathetic.

And one day I said enough is enough, and never went back.  I was done.  I had had enough of wasting my hard earned money on NOTHING. That's when it clicked for me. I was just giving away the money I had earned working all week!  And getting nothing in return but stress and heartache (and anxiety, and heart palpitations, and DEBT.)

You can always quit.  Just never go back.  The first couple of weeks are intense, and it will try to suck you back in, but don't let it!  

Again, if I can beat this devil, so can anyone. 

You've got this!

An epidemic of the wealthy,"Where you at right now, many people would want to trade shoes with you. 

And we are sitting here feeling miserable. 

Not knowing what’s enough. We didn’t need the money in the first place. We just wanted to impress people (on a young age). 

It’s a sickness of the wealthy. Not knowing what’s good already. Always miserable, looking at others and what they’ve got. But always the richer ones. Never the ones who are less wealthy. 

Losing. Chasing. Stuck. The gambling loop of hell.

The idea of gambling is sick. You can become wealthier but you can lose it all. It’s Russian roulette.  But the brain thinks of the possibilities. It tries to be positive and looks for solutions: “yep gambling is a way to make money.” Done thinking; “let’s do this!”

No matter how fucked up your life has become. Stop torturing yourself. You’re still ahead of billions of people in this world, who would do anything to trade shoes with you, even in your current situation. 

Stop your brain in thinking of possibilities with gambling. That it’s not a matter anymore. That you’ve let go. That you’ve let go of the idea of making quick money and trying to impress people. The idea that you had as a 17 year old doesn’t resonate anymore with your current life. You are happy despite what life did to you. That you learned a lesson and lessons are inevitable in life. You became a stronger person. The strongest possible version of you. If life didn’t turned out this way (the shit with gambling) who knows what would’ve happen to you. Maybe you’d be even worse of; eg in prison or dead. 

Life is unimaginably weird and anything can happen. 
And it doesn’t matter.

Life is good just the way it is. Just let go of this fucking thing called gambling 🥴.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1f1zp4t/an_epidemic_of_the_wealthy/,15,3,1724707469,

How do I open up? ,"So, Ive been a gambling addict for the best part of 7 years. In 2020 I opened up to my parents and told them about my addiction. They were obviously extremely disappointed and upset but they agreed to help me out. They took out a loan for me which i used to pay off all my debts and ive been paying them back ever since. The payments are due to end at the end of this month. However on New Years 2022 I relapsed and have been on a downwards sprial ever since, taking out loans, credit cards etc. Ive been a degenerate addict ever since and recently I spent every single penny I had. I haven't spoken to my parents about my addiction since 2020. 

I know that the next few months are going to be horrible. Ive told my girlfriend everything and my friends (who were not very supportive at all) but the next step is to tell my parents (again), not to specifically ask for financial help, but to get everything off my chest and tell them the truth. 

Im really scared, mentally i feel good (despite my situation). I stopped smoking weed at the same time i stopped gambling (about 3 weeks ago) but does anyone have any advise on what to do? I wrote everything i want to say in a message but i need help... for context i am a 25 y/o. thanks ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1f1xla3/how_do_i_open_up/,6,16,1724702080,

Rather just don't do it and live a good life. I'm glad after having so many fuck ups I have decided not to gamble any more. 

Always remember you can win 300% but always lose 100%
Not worth it people. It's unhealthy as fuck. Never give in.

Emotional contagion in this subreddit,"
I’ve been spending a lot of time in this community, and while I know that many people find support here, I’m starting to realize that it’s having the opposite effect on me. Every time I read through the posts, I feel a wave of emotional contagion – like the struggles, relapses, and pain that others are sharing seep into me and intensify my own urges and distress.

It’s like the more I see these repetitive posts, the more I’m reminded of my own addiction, and it’s overwhelming. Instead of feeling supported, I find myself feeling sick, even to the point where just passing by the thread makes me want to vomit. It’s a stark reminder of the height of my addiction and the emotional turmoil that comes with it.

While I understand that this is a place for people to seek help and share their stories, I’m struggling with the impact it’s having on my own recovery. The slim amount of success stories compared to the frequent relapses makes me feel less hopeful, and I’m finding that limiting my exposure to these posts is somewhat effective, but I still feel this lingering heaviness.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? How do you balance seeking support with protecting your mental well-being?",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1f1ejfo/emotional_contagion_in_this_subreddit/,9,7,1724642523,

My boyfriend has a gambling addiction and I don’t know how to help him.,"My boyfriend and I have a very healthy relationship and even though he has some gambling issues, it doesn’t hurt our relationship. He told me he used to play poker a lot before starting dating with me . On our 3rd  or 4th date(I really can’t remember) he didn’t show up and I waited for a good hour, I was genuinely concerned as I didn’t think he was a kind of guy that would ghost a girl like that. Turns out, he was with some friends playing poker and lost a good amount of money and had a bad breakdown. He apologized for hours and said he would stop playing, and he did, at least face to face with his friends. Sometimes he talks about his urge to play, and how it doesn’t feel the same when he is playing a video game type of it and that he craves an actual game. I try to console him but his defense is always that”he is a talented player” and he actually is pretty good at the game. He wins often but still it doesn’t mean he doesn’t lose games.

Just found this interesting...,"Emerging Theme #2: Addiction as Adaptation to Dislocation

The second emerging theme is the growing understanding that contemporary addicted people are not out-of-control slaves to their addiction, but are using their addictions to adapt, as well as they can, to the painful realities of modern life. The primary reason that we live in an “Age of Addiction” is that many people use addiction as a substitute for a full life that they have not been able to achieve, or as a way of escaping from an unbearable emptiness, or both. For many people, addiction is the best solution to pain and desperation that they can find, so they cling tightly to their addictions, even those that may eventually kill them.  

Deep stuff from academia...Bruce K. Alexander is researching gambling addiction.  

I have said that what finally helped me was removal from society, I left the country and implemented my friend's rule of doing anything but gambling. 

It is working.  Nothing has worked in 27/28 years.  So I agree with Bruce. I'm not saying to leave your country but you can change your environment.  That is within your power. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1f0u4q5/just_found_this_interesting/,8,4,1724585024,

659 days gratefully without a bet ,"Today:

I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

I am grateful to see how in-your-face betting is in the UK. There are casinos and betting parlors everywhere. I have much respect to British gambling addicts in recovery. 

I am grateful I got to see all sorts of Beatles landmarks yesterday in Liverpool with my family. 

I am grateful I’m taking my lack of sleep in stride as best I can. Each night is a new adventure in chaos.

I am grateful that I get to learn how to let go each day even when I’m on vacation. My son was really getting stubborn about stuff yesterday, and I realized how much of me is in him. The experience is teaching me that I need to remember to keep perspective and keep letting go, even when I think I’m 100% “right”.

I am grateful to hear the sounds of the seagulls this morning. 

I am grateful that I get to experience a European soccer match for the first time today, and to have the experience of seeing my son and wife have it with me too.

Day 256: Learn to forgive yourself: gambling is the oldest and most deceiving get rich quick scheme known to man ,"I can only speak from personal experience. But many times in my life my wages were low and I thought I could ""beat the system"" with gambling as a side hustle. 

Wrong. All I really needed was patience. Wealth is a grind. I have had years that I made $15,000. I have had years that I made $120,000. 

What I lacked was the faith in myself that when struggling, the situation was only temporary, and no get rich quick scheme or adreline boost (gambling) was going to catapult me to the top. 

Just have faith in yourself, your intellect, and you abilities to get you through the tough times. Never pick any activity to make the tough times the desperate, misguided, depressing times like I did. 

No one has ever said, ""I was struggling but then gambling made my dreams come true!""

Had $100 decided to test my luck with $20 deposit on a site with no minimum cashout. 

So I told myself I’ll just make a deposit & try to atleast double my money. Well I did! I was able to cashout $65

I felt great. Not only because I made a few bucks but also because I stopped myself from playing and immediately withdrawal.

I took my son to the park, made him his favorite meal, today was great.

Well, it’s around 8pm where I am and while I’m settling my child down for bedtime, I got the urge again..

Of course, I got the urge. So I deposited another $10 and got that up to $33. I was happy! Then idk what came over me, I decided to do a few more spins to see if I can get to $50 then I’m done.

Lost it all.

Angry, I deposited another $10 lost that too.

I’m now down to my last $40 I put it on another app and lost it all within 8 minutes only betting 20cent.


I’m so disgusted with myself. I really needed that money. I just wanted to make at least turn my Initial $100 into $150 so I can have extra $$ for the week.

2 weeks now,"Zero access to gambling. I'm working insane hours at 2 jobs now. I literally have close to no energy to even think about gambling. My biggest concern at the moment is not burning myself out. Which is actually ironic because sometimes I would work 8+ hours at 1 job, and then gamble for 8+ hours and get very little sleep, and feel completely energized because of the high gambling gave me. Now that I'm ""sober"" (unfortunately I am still addicted to caffeine and nicotine) at least from gambling, burning the midnight oil actually feels like a real thing. I'm no longer living inside of a fake fantasy dream where one of these nights might be my lucky night and miracle save from my accrued gambling debt.

The real miracle now is putting myself in God's hands and doing legitimate work. Money comes in so slow now it feels like, but I am re-learning truly what my time is worth and how much a dollar is worth again. And the money coming in slow is also met with the money leaving slow. It feels more controlled, my spending (outside of buying coffees on the go or cigarettes), but that can never spiral out of control like a gambling deposit could. I can't smoke a full pack in less than a few days by myself, and that's about $15. Before, I could have easily without thought ""won"" 10x that, even 100x that, $1500 and lost it as quick as it was ""won"".

At the end of my first year I had loans of  45k to my bane from gambling and promised myself that its enough. So I registred to GamBan as a help to stop me and came clean to my family and partner. 

As of yesterday, i felt like shit and noticed that GamBan Dont work on the browser Opera. So i gambled. After 3 years, I relapsed and lost about 7k (took loans out for 3k). 

So here I am, the start of my Journey again. My 40k loan paid of, some exams im behind in and with a new loan of 7k.

Gambling is a drug, but it Can only get better from here. Sorry of my English isnt the best. Not my mother tounge. Thanks for reading. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ezaps8/the_start_of_my_journey/,4,2,1724413813,

First Steps To Recovery,"Dear Community,

I am looking for help and advice. This is a long post but I hope someone will be able to relate and share their thoughts - it would mean the world to me.

I am a 27yo, compulsive gambling addict. For the most part of the last 8 years I have been betting on sports. Had to move jobs, nearly got caught on stealing and pawning multiple items, completely destroyed numerous relationships with family members and partners - all because of my addiction. To state the obvious, I am heavily in debt.

I did seek therapy multiple times. Went to my first therapy (a rehab center) in early 2020 for 2 months and it was successful. I learned how to start turning my life around. Got a job, hit the gym, pursued education. I stayed clean for 20 months.

However, once I relapsed in late 2021 I have never really stopped gambling. Since then, I went to 3 different rehab centers (each of them were 6-8 weeks long stays) and in the meantime I also tried with personal therapists. But I never stopped gambling - I continued lying to everyone around. I never told about all of my loans to anyone; always keeping some debts secret were a ""great"" excuse for me to keep trying to win the money back.

Earlier this week, my family member (parent) has accidentally found out about my biggest debt that I kept secret from everyone and they confronted me about this. Something inside me cracked and I immediately told them about all the remaining debts I have. It was a relief to let it all go, to be honest.

I genuinely want to stop gambling and start living a good life. I am in no denial that I have a huge problem and I know that I need help.

Now, what I don't really know at this point is what kind of help to seek. I tried rehab centers behind closed walls, I tried GA and I tried individual sessions...  
I guess the real problem has been me not really wanting to change my life? Maybe.

What it comes down to right now is:  
A) closed therapy (rehab center) for 2 months  
B) individual therapy + GA, continuing life in real world

My worry for A) is that while during the stay I won't be able gamble, I also won't start learning how to function in the real world without it. Upon return from each of my previous 3 stays in rehab centers, I went back to gambling straight away... That was despite working hard in therapy and feeling strong about my motivation and tools I could use to stay away from gambling.

My worry for B) is that I won't keep my discipline with being in therapy, using my tools to stay clean, going to meetings and keeping the abstinence = leading to even deeper problems and debt.

There are obviously many other factors at play and I don't expect anyone to give me a straight up answer here, give me a magical pill or tell me exactly what to do now. But if you can relate with any of the above, please don't hesitate to comment and share your honest thoughts. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ez9cc8/first_steps_to_recovery/,4,13,1724408983,
Relearning the Value of Money,"I just spent a sleepless night working overtime to earn $6/hour (pretty good pay considering where I live). But it will still take a few years for me to pay off my debts.

It shocks me to realize how crazy stupid I was, when looking back at how I gambled away thousands of $ per session. It takes so long and so much effort to earn back those money, through hard work and not luck.

After the gambling stopped, finally I learn about the value of money again. Back then, money was just merely digits on the screen. 

I'm D17 clean today, and I will continue to learn how good life is, without gambling.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ez7nc6/relearning_the_value_of_money/,28,2,1724402193,
Day 657 gratefully without a bet,"Today:  
·       **I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.**

·       **I am grateful that today it’s officially been 2 years since I re-entered the GA program.**

·       **I am grateful that two years ago today, I surrendered and admitted that I have a gambling addiction and that I needed help.**

·       **I am grateful that on that day, I started to stop thinking that my way was the only way and instead started accepting GA as my higher power and surrendering to what it had to say and the program it said I needed to follow to arrest my addiction.**

·       **I am grateful that even though I relapsed once in November 2022, my recovery journey never stopped.**

·       **I am grateful that 657 days after my relapse, I am in the position to fly with my family to the UK for 10 days. Two years ago, this would have been unthinkable.**

·       **I am grateful that the journey is still ongoing, and I still am learning how to deal with life. Work has thrown me massive curveballs over the last week and I am now in the position where I have to set aside time each day on vacation to work 2-3 hours. Yesterday, I really started panicking inside, couldn’t accept what was going on, lost perspective, and let it all completely overwhelm me.  I didn’t sleep more than a couple hours as well.**

·       **I am grateful that this morning, I’ve reflected on yesterday’s experiences, am learning from them, and am now trying as best I can to let it go.**

·       **I am grateful that I realized again from this morning’s reflection that its truly best for me to trust the Universe and in my growing awareness of the way things are. It is best for me to stop denying reality and let go of clinging to delusions and aversion to future pain that my mind creates, like fears and worries of the biased memories of the past repeating itself.**

·       **I am grateful to continue this path, one day at a time**

Starting Over Today,"I lost my entire paycheck on the 15th in one night. All of my bills including pmts to uncle sam bounced and my bank acct is in the negative. This is the lowest point of my life. I make good money with nothing to show for it. So Im making an action plan to fix my life and stop once in for all 
and have so far accomplished a few things.

Plan:
  
1. Called the State Tax Agency to work with me and they were able to reset my pmt plan. 
2. Called a debt counseling agency to set up a Debt Mgmnt Plan signed the contract with one low monthly payment 5yr plan.
3. Create a budget for when I get paid the next time and the next few months.
4. Cut up all my bank cards so I cannot access my money without having to go to the bank.
5. For my living expense, I have a venmo debit card that I can fund a set amt of money for necessities every paycheck. -this is going to be tricky cause I need to call my bank and find out if they can restrict the amt to just that for my venmo acct.
6. Start saving to payoff my back taxes to the state. 
7. Figure out how to pay off my IRS back taxes off after State is dealt with. I just hope my pmt plan will still be in tact after this fuck up of mine cause I give up on calling the IRS after over 6hrs of being on hold. Just gonna make a payment to cover what was returned by the bank and pray that the next installment happens. 
8. Get therapy and go to GA meetings
9. Pray for a miracle

Need actual advice. Husband $40k in debt. ,"My husband and I have been married for 5+ years. We have a daughter who is 3, and is starting pre-k, which isn’t free where I live. We both make decent money and I have been trying so hard to save money for the last two years, and I just keep spinning my wheels. 

I got an email a few months ago that a transaction was declined due to insufficient funds. I spoke to my husband, he said it wouldn’t happen again. Fast forward to today, he told me he has $40k in cc debt due to gambling. I have a government TS so anything related to mutual gain or deficient must be reported over $10k. 

We have joint accounts because I can’t pay the mortgage on our house but I pay for everything else. 

Please, I’m asking for me some actual advice on how to handle this before I kick him to the curb. 

UPDATE: ALLL THIS HAS BEEN GREAT ADVICE.. thank you!!!! 
his debt is actually around $60k when I calculated our savings over the last 8 months, his car payment that was still automatically going to his account and it had been paid off for 4 months. He took out a $20k 401k loan to correct the cc debt, but spent half on gambling. He doesn’t seem to understand how sever this is, and I am not sure he will unless drastic measures are taken.

“Oh wow”,"Please, read everything, (mentions money)

Long time lurker, never even had a reddit account to make this post but I've been around here for a long long time. I used to visit this sub back in 2022 when I started gambling, I used to check this to try and teach myself what would happen if I lost control and here I am, sharing my situation with you all.

Earlier this year in February I had a run from 1k to 45k, I won't detail much about how I won as it would take a really long time. Lost the 45k, I was desperate, suicidal. Next week I sell my phone and go back again, ran it up to 60k, bought a new top notch phone and lost it all in 2 days, after a few weeks I do it again and run it up to 85.500$, lost it in a week. After losing that 85.500$ I was convinced it was over, in shock. My girlfriend was sleeping over, right on my side and I didn't know what to do, I had just lost what some people will not even make in their lives (I live in Brazil so that's around 440k in my currency, I'm struggling a little bit with the values as I am converting to yall). I was desperate, crying like crazy, and she didn't even wake up. In the morning I told her that it would be better if she left me, didn't give much details on why just acted really weird. I called my mom that night too who comforted me but she couldn't really do anything.

My credit score was really good because I had moved around 700k USD in deposits/withdrawals just out of gambling. My girlfriend started distancing, she visited me 15 days later and brought me lunch and then we stopped talking. We didn't even ""break up"", she was just gone as I requested, that was around 5 months ago, my fall was Feb-Mar. I spent all these last 5 months chasing it. I had hit it 3 times in the span of a month? It was sure doable. Wrong. I was failing all the time, I couldn't get it past 5k. Tons and tons of debt. I'd always lose it all in the end, until yesterday, I had a really good session and managed to win 10k on slots. 

Today, early in the morning my ex messages me about her birthday, inviting me to dinner and I was thinking oh my God, it's finally happening, I'll be able to restart from scratch, I will get all my money back. I had fun in the week I was ""rich"", spent some on stuff I always wanted to buy, nice gifts for my family and my girl, no financial stress. So I checked tonight's games and saw Palmeiras x Botafogo for the Libertadores, a soccer match in my hometown, Palmeiras needed to get this win to go to the penalty shootout, or win by 2+ to qualify with no shootout as Botafogo won the first game so AGG it was 1x0 Botafogo. I went all in on Palmeiras. Botafogo goes up 2x0, but I've seen Palmeiras comeback from 3x0. 2nd half, 86 minutes of match, Palmeiras make it 2x1, I had already considered my bet lost and 4 minutes after, Palmeiras draws the game, 2x2. Injury time, I was praying to God asking for the win, I'd be happy to stop with 17k is what I was telling myself. 90+5, injury time, Palmeiras defender scores with a header, 3x2 Palmeiras, I was saved right? my ex's birthday, everything would be fine, I would restart my life, no more suicidal thoughts. I was celebrating, shouting like crazy, and then VAR comes in, the goal is called off, offside.

It's funny, I used to rage really bad and break stuff but all I could do was say to myself ""Oh wow, oh wow, I just lost it all"", I was not as desperate as I was when I lost my 85.500$, I was just numb, I took my xans and took a nap to try to process what just happened and here I am looking for advice/help. My dad hates me because he knows I lost that 85.500$, we haven't talked a lot since then, I feel useless as I don't have any talents, highschool dropout, a lot of anxiety. I'm just reflecting on how this addiction/money affects so much my life, how can money control us so much? How are oddsmakers so precise? How can these things that are able to ruin our lives be a few clicks away and in our pockets? I don't know what to do. 

I am not asking for money, I might even delete my account after this, I shared a lot of my personal life and issues gambling brought with it and that's just the tip of the iceberg, trust me. I feel like people don't care about you if you don't have money other than your family & friends, maybe I am insecure with myself and I try to use money, expensive stuff, gambling and all that shit to cover my insecurity, I just don't know. I am sorry if I sound like a stupid spoiled kid, but trust me, I am a compulsive gambler and I feel ruined, I am just trying to think logically here. And I think that some of you might have advice. Maybe if I had won that 17k I wouldn't have stopped, most likely, I would try to get my 85.500$ back.

I just feel worthless, this addiction has been really debilitating I've been struggling with severe anxiety and family issues other than the financial part with my family, my family also struggles financially. What do I do? This is a lot falling on me right now and I am not sure on how to react even though I am trying to approach it logically. Debt, crippling anxiety, lost my girlfriends, my family's trust, my dad, my mental sanity. How do I cope with the suicidal thoughts? I feel like killing myself to escape this but this is so confusing, I am truly lost and sharing this because it might be relatable for some, or you might have some more experience. I know I sound stupid and my view on money might be different because of my age (just turned 19), but well guys, that's it. I wanted to share tonight's loss with you and my struggle with gambling addiction.

Can someone talk to me? I might sound calm here but I am panicking inside. Is there a way to work in the US or another country that doesn't have slave wagers like here in Brazil? Any jobs Id take.  Maybe I didn't make my story very clear, I am really nervous as I type this. Please someone talk to me and give me a light at the end of this dark tunnel, I am desperate and sharing my personal issues with gambling/personal relationships as they're interlinked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1eyaukt/oh_wow/,8,7,1724302097,

2 weeks free,"Debt 60k - didn’t had any savings to lose only debt. Last year I’ve been in 60k debt and was almost done with it this month, but the past 2 months racked up another 60k. So another year slave. God help us all overcome this disease.

I live in a poor country but I am lucky to win a lot of money.

I only gamble when I use substances.


My plan to discover myself, to understand what s wrong inside my head and to pay this debt in 10 months.

1. all my finances are at my mother, she will pay the debts and I will only have access to cash
2. start kickboxing 6 days / week (i m in kick boxing since 23 years old, now I am 29) / swimming 2 days / week - get shredded till next year so at least in this year I will accomplish having a great body till I get out of debt. Will cook only healthy food at home.
3. continue working 2 jobs and trying to get another side husstle to get a 3rd income
4. read at least 2 books / month related to dopamini, bad habits, addiction
5. start a few courses to improve my knowledge for my work as a software engineer
6. quit substances use, alcohol and cigarettes
7. Started ga and got a sponsor
8. go to church and daily pray
9. Will not pay my debts for a few months so I will not be able to take any loan for at least 4 years
10. Will also join na groups and take 1 more sponsor
11. 1 time / month see a psychiatrist 

Did I miss something from the list ? I know it’s much but I can do it, most of them I was already doing before those mixed addictions took over my life and destroyed it.

Last year i’ve made it 8 months with abstinence from substances and gambling but didn’t work on myself, ga, psychiatrist, sponsors for both ga and na. And all it took to get back to where I was last year was to start crypto and a few relapses gambling (not crypto, but crypto caused me to go back to sustancences and gambling and a few relapses like that ruined me (high stakes).

Her proposal is CBT and she train me how to think, when that small voice(demon) whispers to me: "" let's try with just 100€ and get out, win or lose we are going out"", how to stop that train of thought. She really did some crazy stuff to put me in all kinds of emotion and state of mind(using some dutch medicine, some kind of light psychedelic) she really helped me. And even told me  she can be my safe place to put money and credit card away when I have to go to that town for business where is that only and one casino I gamble. I never ever gamble in my town or online, only that one specific casino. And guess what guys I heard they are moving away on another destination next week. So that one specific casino will forever disappear. I know it's long post, and not so helpful to others but I'm doing it for myself. So sorry for taking your precious time if someone read all. Also I told her about this app and she recommended me to distance from all negative story's from here, I hope everyone get better and beat this addiction I will from now on post just milestones here.

I messed up. ,"Well, I have been gambling online for about a year. At the beginning I was up. I would place small bets and win like 1k off of it. From there.. I was chasing that feeling. Also being able to provide for my family a little more was really rewarding. I felt like I broke the system in a way or had really good luck.

Recently I've been gambling on slots and I have been losing way more. Sometimes winning pretty big. 

Yesterday I messed up really really badly and pretty much spent all of my money (1k) on gambling and I feel horrible. I just kept buying small packages thinking I was fine and it added up. I played until like 3AM. I feel so dumb. I cannot believe I did that. I need help.

Day 17 - been exposed,"I wrote my first post here a few weeks back to document my recovery. I've been working hard to keep myself sober and managed to hit day 17. For someone who couldn't go 2 days without the thought of gambling, this is a real achievement for me. Here are some of the things I've found useful: speaking to a therapist on a weekly basis; reading reddit posts daily; working out; keeping a recovery journal and watching Dave Ramsey (who I cannot recommend enough). My mind feels so clear compared to where I was a few weeks ago and I feel less anxious. But, as the title suggests, I've been exposed and the extent of my situation has been exposed.

For context, I have been living with my girlfriend now for the past 3+ weeks. I had a complete breakdown to her around this time and she begged me to come stay with her. I had just relapsed, lost all my savings, and just lost my recent pay check. She has been nothing but supportive to me and I am so grateful for everything she's done for me.

 Anyway, I'm really not proud of my actions and I feel so ashamed of everything I've put her and my friends through. There is a lot of background details which will take too long to explain but today I was exposed and met with the harsh reality of the effects of gambling addiction.  So, I recently borrowed some money from a friend (let's call him J). He is a really good mate and has helped me out on numerous occasions before. He knows I have a problem with gambling but after he lent me this money I told him that I wouldn't ask him for financial help again. However, after I lost my most recent pay check, I stooped to a new low. I messaged one of our mutual friends and asked whether he could help me out. He didn't know about my addiction but luckily he said No and I couldn't be more grateful for that.

 For the past few days, I've had a gut feeling that something wasn't right. I've been seeing weird messages in the group chat J and I are in with our other mates and a lot more messages/GIFs around gambling and addiction than usual (I had never told my other mates about my addiction. I told J and another friend of ours but neither of them knew the other knew because I begged them not to tell anyone). Deep down I knew that these messages/GIFs were aimed at me but, as I've been away from home for so long, I just thought that maybe they've got an inside joke running between them. 

Well, that was until I randomly received a phone call from J this afternoon. I quickly realised that the truth of my gambling had been exposed and not long after I answered he erupted into anger and started to hold me to account for the things I've said/done. I feel sick to my stomach, it honestly was one of the hardest phone calls I've ever had to deal with but, from his perspective it was necessary. He said that he had known about me asking my other friend for money since Monday 12^(th). 10 whole days he had been bottling everything up. But now I just think that everything has been miscommunicated through hearsay and he probably thinks I've been manipulating him and my other mates. That was genuinely never my intentions. As I'm sure you all know, this is a horrific disease which really turns the best of us into monsters we don't recognise.

I am so ashamed about everything. I feel like my life is such a mess. All the constant lies had finally caught up with me. But, that’s what gambling addiction does, it isolates you and makes you spin a web of lies to try mask the shame of your actions.

Anyway to cut a long story short. I don't really know what to do from here. I am obviously going to stay sober from gambling but, I just feel very overwhelmed about everything. I am meant to be going home from my gfs on Saturday and I said I'd meet him but, I'm just scared about what's going to happen. I really don't want to go back but, I've been cowardly hiding away for weeks now. I sent him a letter today via email. My therapist recommended that I do this. I just wrote down how I was feeling, my apology and some of the actions I've been taking since the beginning of the month to stay sober because he wanted to see some action from me and a plan on how I'm going to make this right.

So yeah, sorry for the long read guys. There is more to the story but it's too long to write everything down. I just feel sick. Any advice on how to handle this with my mate will be appreciated. I am hoping to try tell him my story on how I've ended up here but I don't want to come across as ""feeling sorry for myself"". Also, sorry if my story doesn’t make much sense, I think I'm still in shock at everything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ey5bxl/day_17_been_exposed/,5,6,1724285526,
Todays Day 1,"I’ve gambled since I was 18. First it was scratch its, than trips to the casino, and eventually I’ve found myself gambling online.

Online has been my downfall. There is no exit, it’s always at my fingertips, and the games are engaging and fast paced. 

I’ve lost and I’ve lost and I’ve lost, yet I keep going back. I’ll find a new casino (after I’ve self excluded from others) and lose more.

I’ve told myself I would quit hundreds of times, and have felt the bitter shame and sadness of losing hard earned money. I’ll do good for a while, and then I’ll be tempted to place just ‘one little bet’ online. Always end up spiraling and losing my deposit plus more.

But today is the day that I quit. I have lurked on this subreddit for months now, and I’m ready to stop. I will take the advice of others and never place another bet again in my life.

Hoping this place can be my safe haven when temptations comes.

It’s never enough,"Started online gambling a few years ago. I ended up losing 60k(all my savings) and being in debt about 25k. Made the 25k back early last month and had about 10k extra.

“I had it all”, gambling debt was covered, I had extra money I could spend on myself, now I’m 7k in cc debt again.

journalist seeking interviews with online betters over 50,"I am a writer for AARP magazine, which is a magazine for senior citizens read by roughly 38 million people.

I've been asked to do a story about how the explosion of online gambling, mostly online sports betting, is affecting people over 50.

I've been asked to find people over 50 who've struggled with problem gambling that was either driven by or worsened by online gambling or online sports betting. Our goal is to highlight issues and offer solutions to an extremely large readership that is particularly susceptible to the dangers of gambling.

To tell the story, I need to try and interview people who can explain to a wider audience the tumult this has created in their lives. **This request has received moderator approval.**

I know it's a lot to ask, but I need to find people who will be comfortable letting me use their real names and be photographed. All I promise in return is that I will be truthful and respectful and sensitive in telling these stories, and that I will outline as best I can exactly what to expect throughout the process.

I'd like to hear from anyone over 50 who is willing to share their story, or anyone who might be able to help me reach someone who fits this description. Happy to explain more then.

Thank you for your consideration.

Day 1… Young guy just trying to get it right.,Day 1 of who knows of how many tries this time. Im sitting here typing this after losing my last 175 I had in a gambling account. I am a 24 year old male and I have been wrapped up witb a gambling addiction the past 2-3 years. My biggest loss in one time reaching up to 12-14k over a 2 week stretch. I just did that again not too long ago. Im not in any serious debt that will conflict my life too much but I think the issue is I just want to so hard belive that I can sports bet. And Believe me my luck isnt all that bad and I actually do/did make profit but where I become compulsive is the online casino. And I will never be able to escape the trap of the online casino so as much as I dont want to give up betting I am going to have to. I need to kill these strong emotions I have for gambling and just move on with my life before I do some real damage. Which I think I already done. Im sorry to my parents who try to be there for me every time but I fail countless times. This time I am committed and I will come back to this page as much as I need to remind myself.

How to tell my mom about relapse.,"So i'm 19 and my mom has been trying to help me with my addiction. We made a deal that I would give my money to her and she can  transfer to me when i need it.

I contacted some people who know about gambling addiciton. They told me to download betblocker which I did, and to go to an online ga meeting, which I am going to do. But still my mom is going to be broken about this. How can I assure her that I really want to change. The guilt is so overwhelming.

Have I hit rock bottom?,"Tonight, I drove to the casino and lost another 1,500 that I didn't have to spare. My addiction with gambling has come fast and strong and I am spiraling. The past 3 months I have won and lost 400K. My obsession with gambling videos gave me the bright idea to gamble way outside of my allowable budget which depleted my winnings. The sad thing is, I was so ahead, but then I started following gambling social media influencers trying to play like them and the losses started rolling in HARD. Everything I won, immediately went back into the slot machines, and then it became a pattern of trying to chase my losses. It's gotten to the point where I am forced to sale my house due to my expenses and debt can no longer be managed. Sadly enough, I was already planning in my head how much of my equity to take to the casino to try and recoup loses. Sometimes I sit back back and feel extremely stupid because the wins initially outweighed the losses by far and I got so greedy and I wish there was a reset button. When does the desire to chase a loss end, how do you let it go. It go so bad that I was literally driving 2 hours daily to the casino. I sit back and look at my win loss and am just so disappointed.

"I feel like self exclusion doesn’t work for me, using different methods this time around after repeated failure. Already feel better than ever before in this journey.","Hear me out before downvoting. I am at the beginning of my gamble free life and I feel different than all of quitting attempts before this. I am feeling optimistic and truly seeing gambling for the disgusting, trashy, pathetic and degenerative habit it is. And I don’t feel the need to block myself from online casinos. (I don’t have a problem with physical casinos nor do I feel the need to visit them. I’m strictly addicted to online slots only)

In my past quitting attempts, I’ve taken one year or 6 month self exclusions on as many online casinos I could, and doing this only gave me this inner feeling of desperately needing to find a way to do it more. I then found social casinos, crypto casinos or a new online casino popped up. And then when I finally broke through to access, I relapsed worse than ever because of the built up deprivation I felt from being blocked. 

Apps like Gamban also are useless to me because I can uninstall them in minutes. And bottom line to me is that the online gambling world is way too growing and huge that trying to self exclude from all online gambling possibilities seems extremely draining and impractical.

Instead this time around, I am using my logical mind. I am seeing myself as the new version of me who doesn’t gamble. I’m accepting closure of the damage gambling has caused and choosing to not let it destroy me more. 

Im giving myself the freedom of having the choice of getting back on an app and ruining my life, but I’m trusting my new found judgement and the picture of the life I want to live, to realize that it is absolutely pointless. I’m finding different constructive activities and productive apps on my phone to fill the time I used gambling. (For me I’ve found a new found love of journaling on my phone)

And if I ever feel old parts of me that creep up and want to gamble, I’ll write all of those feelings down, read it, feel it, use my better judgment and keep moving forward to the person I want to be.

This practice might seem stupid to a lot of you but it feels absolutely different than any of the times I tried to quit in the past. Self exclusion almost unleashes a childlike part of my brain that wants what I can’t have, and I always find a way to get it and the destruction is awful. Something about being blocked from gambling makes me want it more and causes frustration for me and makes my addiction feel more unbearable than ever. 

So this time I’m not doing it. I just deleted the apps. Out of sight out of mind. I don’t live that life anymore and I have no desire to go back.

Many of you will probably tell me this method will fail and I’m prepared for that. But I’m more confident ever that this is it. It feels different than any of the other times I’ve tried to quit gambling. This time around it doesn’t even feel like quitting something. It feels like an exciting and hopeful new beginning and I can’t wait to see what this new life brings me. A life that would never be possible with gambling.

how to block myself from websites?,"hey all. in june i self excluded through my state so that banned me from participating in any gambling apps (draftkings, betmgm, etc) however, when i was drunk the other night i found a few different websites that weren’t blocked by that self exclusion. i assume they’re not regulated by the state. they’re international gaming sites or something? so i was wondering am i able to prevent this from happening in the future?",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1eww97m/how_to_block_myself_from_websites/,6,7,1724162219,
Giving this a try *long post* ,"Hello everyone. I don’t really know where to begin. First, I want to say that I am incredibly proud of every single person on here. Reading everyone’s stories and realizing the similarities between the way my brain works and all of you is so enlightening, we truly are not alone. 

I’ve tried so many different ways of keeping myself accountable through the years. Right now, it’s a mix between not having any access to funds and my husband managing every single penny of mine that comes in, and being self excluded from every gambling site I can think of. 

I’m 24, F, and have been gambling since I was 17 years old. My entire family gambles so I was introduced to it super early- and that mixed with seeing my parents struggle with money my entire life I think has somehow led me here. 

I had my first big wins early on, ultimately landing me here. Lots of times I wish I would’ve never won. I envy people who hate the casino. I got so addicted to the fast money. 

I married my husband 2 years ago and I would’ve never guessed that we would be where we are today. I have completely ruined us financially. When I met him he had about 25k saved up and I remember being so blown away. I never knew anyone who didn’t live paycheck to paycheck (myself included.) Today, we are sitting at 20k in credit card debt and 0 in savings. Where’d it all go? My gambling. 

He has bailed me out too many times to count, to think about it makes me physically ill. 

For so long it was a cycle of me using the money supposed to be used for rent, or the car payment money, or the grocery money, and gambling it all away until he said “no more” and I now have a bank account with no direct deposits, and I can only make my credit card payments with his supervision (bc if not I’ll use the money to gamble)

I feel defeated. I’ve completely lost his trust. Not to mention, I’ve been a horrible life partner to him. I have dreams of us buying a home, raising a family, and living a long happy, comfortable life together. But I don’t trust myself and he doesn’t trust me. I’m scared he’ll always see me as a ticking time bomb, who drains her bank account as soon as things are good again. Every time it happens I swear it never will again, but after a few weeks the feeling of self disgust goes away and the idea of gambling doesn’t sound so bad anymore. 

We had a long talk last night when I told him that I was feeling like gambling (my last 2k bender was last week) and he reassured me that I can get through this and that he believes in and loves me but I have to try a different approach this time. I don’t know how he can still love me after everything I’ve put him through, but I thank god that he does everyday. 

I’ve read this forum on and off again through the past 3 or 4 months and have never tried participating. I see all of you badasses on here taking back your lives and it makes me so incredibly proud!!! I’m ready to join in on this. 

Here goes day 1 of taking my life back & being the person I want to be. 

Have a wonderful day & if you read this far you rock and we got this! 🩷

You cannot be self destructive ,It started with loneliness unconcontrolled access the promise of a regulated casino online only to experience crashing games seeing loss hoping the next paycheque can get me even. But brothers this is a trap. Out of 100000 broke and so many loans you won’t guess who saved me. I was asleep but when I am trying with my brain to wake up I just couldn’t get my body to move. So I thought I am dead. Then I said Jesus please help me. Miraculously I woke up. With nothing left to my name I have lasted 8 months and after this I just self excluded. Please brothers there are curses within slots that money belongs to someone else in pain the negative entity is strong even if you win it will not let you keep it.

Today is my 29th birthday and I’m setting myself free.,"Today I had a moment that hit me in the face like 100 bricks. I went to renew my drivers license had to take a new picture. Looking at that new picture, I didn’t recognize that girl. She looked underweight, stressed, miserable, strung out, unhealthy and mentally unwell. I looked at my old picture, healthy, hopeful, happy, smiling, beautiful. The person in that new picture is the person that gambling has turned me into. And I feel a feeling I’ve never felt before in all my attempts to quit. 

I just finished reading easy way to stop gambling by Allen Carr I feel like that along with the license picture experience today, I’ve flipped some kind of switch in my brain. 

Gambling is absolutely foul and by choosing to do it, we are choosing to stay miserable. I’ve always had this idea that I could casually gamble for fun, but now I’m realizing it’s not fun. Why would the practice that destroys us be fun?? The thought of never gambling again makes me feel hopeful, excited and at peace. The high we feel when we get a hit on gambling isn’t happiness or a good feeling. It only feels good because we choose to put ourselves in jeopardy and agony when we gamble, and that “good feeling” is relief. But we wouldn’t need that relief if we didn’t gamble in the first place. That’s why winning big feels 100 times better when we are down. Because the relief is more intense. It’s a mind game that we simply have to choose to not fall for.

I know you’re probably rolling your eyes thinking you’ve heard this all before, that this mindset shift is temporary and I’ll be back in a few days, but I genuinely believe I’ve had an epiphany about gambling. Today is going to be my new beginning. Today was my last day being the girl in that new license picture. Hopefully having to see it on my license will be an ongoing reminder to never be her again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ewoc7t/today_is_my_29th_birthday_and_im_setting_myself/,18,2,1724134174,
Day 21 - A little rant and future lesson to someone the same age as me,"
My story begins in late 2019 with my mom getting diagnosed with Stage 4 Ovarian Cancer. I was barely 18 at the time and was just about to graduate high school. I thought my life was messy at the time but oh boy my old self would never imagine what I have to deal with now. Throughout the time of COVID I tried to be supportive but my mom’s condition kept getting worse. It was just heartbreaking and I couldn’t fathom what was going on in my life. I ended up starting to gamble with money I had saved up through my business I started in high school to fulfill something I felt I was missing in my life. As the only child, I felt alone and I yearned for someone to talk to and I guess the casino was somewhere that fit that need. During that time, I was still going to school and was still somehow doing good. During mid 2021, my mom started a new experimental treatment for her cancer and she started to get better. But during that time I started to lose excessive amounts of money. I felt horrible but still kept going with school and supporting my mom. 

At the end of 2021, I found out the experimental treatment was not working as intended, in which my mom chose to go into hospice care and that dove me deeper into a state of depression and manic gambling which forced me to borrow money to continue gambling. During that time I finally started to apply to colleges to start transferring too. This continued for a span of a couple months and then I was near 20k in debt. I finally decided to go into therapy but that only lasted 3 sessions. I told myself, I need to finally came clean to my parents about my gambling problem because I knew my mom had little to no time left. My parents were heartbroken to hear that and told me that I would need to work to pay it off. I decided I needed to do that and during that time was when college decisions started coming out. However, one night in April of 2022 I came home and said hi to my mom and said good night to her. She was in bad shape and I didn’t know that the good night was about to be the last words I would say to her. I went to sleep and at 6 am my dad came into my room and said your mom had passed away.  This was when things got significantly worse for me.

My mom’s ashes were spread in her favorite national parks in Canada and California during the summer of 2022. During that time I got accepted to the dream college of which my mom and dad were excited for me to go to. However, my gambling kept getting worse and during the trip to spread my mom’s ashes I just kept gambling to fill the void of something I was trying to find. I ended up confessing to my dad about it and there was a whole argument about it and he ended up paying some of my debt off. I was now just paying off the debt I accrued during 2021. Fast forward to the start of my transfer year, I had hopes and dreams of starting school, finally finding a career, paying off my debts and finding a girlfriend. However, despite my best efforts it took a while for me to understand what I really wanted and alongside the grief I felt, it was tough for me to form the things and relationships that I wanted to do during my time in college. I just felt lonely and destroyed and resorted back to my old ways of gambling. I ended up taking out 70k in student loans I didn’t need and maxed out my credit cards to get by, which my dad does not know about. Alongside this I did end up getting an internship out of state at a reputable company, however, due to my own personality and anxiety I ended up getting fired for it. I still felt hope in mind for my situation but during the end of 2023, my dog that I raised since 5th grade was shot by my neighbors with a pellet gun and ended up passing away. He was such a good dog and that put me into a deeper hole. I ended up graduating this year with no job offer and it feels so defeating after losing so much in the past couple of years. The positive thing is that I started to go to therapy and stopped gambling for good, however, I still cannot find a job, I miss my dog and my mom, I’m about to file for bankruptcy, and life just feels so bleak for me right now.

Lost count of the days,"It's been right around 4 months. I haven't gambled at all, I feel guilty even looking in the direction of the lottery kiosk in the grocery store. I think I was in debt around 22k in credit cards and of course I owed a ton to the IRS on all those jackpots I won and didn't take taxes out and then gave right back to the casino. I am clawing my way out of this hole and doing really really well. Taxes are paid off at least and I'm paying about 25-50 more than the minimums and my credit is rebounding. I will NEVER put my life in jeopardy ever again.

I deleted all apps and betting websites and the emptiness is unreal,"I'm sitting in my house and everything feels so quite and still. I'm desperate to check fixtures stats and latest scores.

When does this feeling if ever go.

I guess it's just what my mind is used to so it's wanting to do those things. If one doesn't do them for a while it won't desire them.

But then the funny thing is how quiet and empty my brain is. How underwhelming and quiet an experience watching TV for example is compared to the high buzz of checking stats and making bets whoch is in reality the same as checking a spreadsheet or somwthibg like low level accountancy work which would otherwise be mundane.

This empty dull feeling is kinda crippling. I guess must be like an alcoholic craving a drink so bad?

I wanna make a bet so I can win money and get money but the irony is I'd be better off if I didn't bet.

So less time and less work with 0 betting would lead to more money for me and more free time yet my brai despite years of losses is still chasing a big win lol

Guys I need help today,"	TL;DR After a lot of ups and downs gambling this year, I’m currently in the midst of a downturn. How do I come to grips with what would be considered a smaller loss before it gets out of hand and turns into an even bigger one? What thought can I keep coming back to help me feel like everything will be fine as long as I stop now? Before knowing I had a solid last win helped keep the urges away but now I feel like that’s gone and there’s nothing I can do to make up for it. I think I got a taste of not having to worry so much about money for a second and now I’m back to that anxiety and it’s driving my crazy



Just need help kicking this feeling I have right now and I’m going to try to not ramble on and on here. But here’s a little back story and I’ll just keep it to this year because my whole gambling career has been a rollercoaster. 

	From August of last year until December I had been doing pretty good fighting my urges and just accepting the shit hole of debt I was in. After working so many extra hours at the end of the year and not gambling I was able to survive the holidays money wise but just barely. MY wife and I then found out we were pregnant which I was so excited about but obviously so scared money wise. Then at the beginning of the year I started to backslide. I slowly started accumulating more debt on my credit card gambling. Thinking here we go again…then my prayers are answered and I get a huge tax return that I was not expecting. Damn near brought me to tears. My wife had been wanting to go on vacation one last time before the baby and that helped so much. Before I received that I had kicked around the idea of doing a loan with my dad as a co-signer to help pay off all the credit cards and be done with gambling for good. Mind you I have one other loan that is almost paid off from my previous really bad run in 2021 so figured this will get me over the hump.

	So time goes by, our vacation cost more than I expected and we’re buying baby stuff and the extra money is dwindling quickly and not all of the credit card are fully paid off yet. So what do I do…I start to gamble a little bit. The credit card balance starts going up. Then hallelujah I get my balance up to $10k buuut I don’t cash out and I lose it all. Worst feeling ever. That was my one shot. But by the grace of God I run it back up to 10K and cashout. Okay now I just need to be done. But nope I think I can just play a little more. A few buy ins later I go on a run that I haven’t gone on since 2021 where I ran it up to 50k and lost it all back and then so much more (hence the loan). I get it up to 25k holy shit I couldn’t believe. I did the hard part and cashed out thank God. But now of course there’s a little “rakeback” bonus. Okay that’s fine, if I lose this it’s not my money. So of course I run that bonus up to 13k and once you’re on a run like that it’s not even satisfying anymore. I’m thinking well now I want more so I can pay the debts and not touch the 25K. “This isn’t enough money like I thought it would be” but of course I push it aggressively and lose all the bonus money. But I was proud of myself, I was still able to hang my hat on the original big win and let that be enough. A month goes by and fueled by the fact that I just won enough to get me back to cover losses dating all the way back to last year I was happy. 

	Okay, now to the part I need help with. A month goes by, a lot of debt is paid but money in my account is dropping. Something I thought was interesting and was maybe a good sign of where my head was at money wise was I decided to buy myself a new iPad a couple of weeks ago on sale but man did I feel guilty about it. I couldn’t stop thinking about returning it. It was $1000 and I actually have something useful from it so I don’t know why I couldn’t just be happy. I have literally tilted and lost 4 x times that amount in a night. But…since the bank account has only gone down now my mind for the first time in a month decided to think about that bonus 13K. Man if only I cashed that out. But okay, whatever stop thinking about it. With our baby due at the end of this month, my wife has entered a nesting faze where she wants our house completely ready for his arrival. So all of a sudden putting in new floors and turning our living room into a dining room has to be done RIGHT NOW. Okay, that’s fine. I’m still financially okay to handle this I think but again that bonus money would have been nice. 

	Well then I noticed that my last run put me only 3% away from reaching diamond status on the site I use, a milestone I thought I’d never hit. And I know the bonus from that would be pretty awesome. So last week I buy in just a little to see how much I can move that percentage up knowing damn well this is what the site wants you to do. It wants you to go bankrupt trying to get the bonus. So long story short, I’ve tilted the last week to the tune of $7k and feel sick about it. Although I know if I stop now I think I’ll be fine but God why did I even do that. I just want to go back to last week. Do I return the iPad now? Even though that feels like a loss to. Returning something and Getting money back to cover a loss isn’t satisfying at all compared to returning something to have a net positive. Basically what I need help with is how do I see this last weeks loss as not back breaking? And why does any way I can think of to get that money back not satisfy these constants thoughts of dread? Like I want to tell myself it’s fine you’ll pick up extra shifts, sell something’s in a garage sale, etc. But it doesn’t help. Cause I keep thinking of how I could have done all of these things last week and it could have been a net positive. That 7k loss is just a gaping hole now.

Thank you guys for letting me get all of that off my chest. As most of you guys probably experience, I only have myself to talk about all of this with so it’s nice to be able to tell somebody. Hang in there everyone and thank you for all the words of encouragement!",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ew733v/guys_i_need_help_today/,1,2,1724086957,
Sports gambling addict can’t stop even after 30+ years,"Hello All, 
I’ve been a sports gambling addict for over 30 years and cannot stop. This is the first time I’ve written about this to anyone. I’ve been gambling since 17 years old and currently I’m 52. I make 100K per year in my corporate job and after paying bills, every dollar has been poured into gambling. I don’t have much debt however my credit is shot(below 600) due to gambling through the years. I gamble mainly on sports. 

Sports is a 24/7 addiction. There is always action seven days a week at every hour. There is NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL to filll the majority of your days. Then there is Tennis and Euro Soccer to fill the odd hours of the morning if you’re in the US. Sometimes there is always that 1-2 hours where there’s nothing going on and to feel that void, I will bet table tennis(ping pong). Many will joke on how much can you possibly lose on ping-pong however my sportsbook allows $500 per bet and you can bet several times during one match and can easily lose several grand on a 10 minute match of ping-pong. 

I’ve wagered on every possible type of bet you could think of whether it be who scores the next point in tennis, who wins the third quarter in NFL, player props, how many corners will a team score in soccer, how many points scored in ping-pong… you name it, I have bet on it. 

I have lost well over $1 million lifetime in gambling. During the crypto craze of 2016, I acquired over 100 bitcoins which is equivalent to $6 million in today’s prices but as expected, have gambled all of that away in less than a year. I get paid about 8K every month after taxes and will be getting paid this Friday. I will most likely gamble this away as well. 

Half of me wants to quit but the other half isn’t ready. I’m such an idiot and don’t know what other reasons I need to quit. It is a vicious never ending cycle. I have been addicted to hard street drugs in my younger years and also addicted to pharmaceutical drugs in my later years but fortunately have been able to completely release myself from those addictions. I have been drug free for over 15 years now. I’ve been able to overcome all my addictions but gambling.

I worry about the future of our nation ever since gambling has been legalized in many states. I don’t think our government has taken into consideration how devastating this addiction is and it affects much more people than estimated. They also didn’t consider how AI and metrics driven software has completely changed the landscape of sports betting. I work in technology and can foresee the predatory nature of these sports betting companies. 

It is cathartic for me to write this so thanks to anyone that has listened. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ew5d47/sports_gambling_addict_cant_stop_even_after_30/,37,14,1724082874,

It’s just not worth going down that path and I know what the end result will be. Really trying to not let it beat me this time. No gambling at all, at any amount. I’m done.

My wife is still worried. I hid this disease from her for over 20 years. I racked up 400K in debt and since we're in a community property state, my debt is her debt. I make too much income to file for bankruptcy. 

I'm 320 days clean, but everything I've read says that a relapse is very likely at some point in the future. She's agreed to help me fight this, but wants to know what the best way to protect herself and our kids in case I fall off the wagon. Even writing this post, I can think of 3 or 4 different ways I could get cash if i really wanted to (not going to list them here to give ideas). 

Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you!

Day 6 - doing okay ,"Day 6 

Got no struggle to keep away from the gambling, but it would be a lie if i say i wasn’t thinking about it. 

I’m going on holiday in 2 weeks with my girlfriend and have no money until 1 week. But minus the bills and debt money, There is not much left. I’ll be okay tho, as long as i’m not gambling it. But i won’t.

Also working on a plan how i’m going to repay everyone. I think it might work. 

Also been hitting the gym HARD again and eating right again.

Blessed for another day.

need some advice,"so, i’m (F28) not the gambler. but i am the breadwinner of the family. my partner (M30) struggles with poly substance abuse and so have i but we have been sober (me for about a year, him for about 6 months) but he’s started using one of those online casinos. we have an almost 3 year old and he has known since we met i have very strong feelings about gambling, my father used to gamble and i have been very upfront that this is not something i will tolerate. especially when i am the one supporting us. anyway, i made the mistake the other night of not locking my card before i put the baby to bed and he wasted no time. he spent $470. we live in an area that was recently effected by a storm, our power was out for days and it put us in a bad spot. we were already behind on rent. i had barely scraped up enough to clear the previous months debt and pay down this months a little less than halfway. well, that money is gone, pissed away. when i saw the charges the following morning i couldn’t even look at him. he’s not a stupid guy, he has a fucking masters degree!! i just couldn’t believe he could do this to me, but most importantly our daughter. i spent the majority of the day hysterically crying and panicking, honestly it was hard, especially considering that i don’t even have a year sober. this was a lot for me. i’m not irrational or cruel, i understand he is probably more ashamed than i could ever make him feel, but fuck dude i’m tired of babying a grown man and handling him with kid gloves when i already have a kid. he knew i would never agree to it. and quite frankly i have reacted just as negatively when he’s won. a win is even worse in my eyes, because it makes him believe that he’s in control and it’s not a fucking algorithm designed to drain his pockets. i have told him that if he wants to remain in a relationship with me in any capacity that isn’t coparents then he needs to seek professional help and address the compulsion. i can’t let this happen again. it is a risk to my sobriety at this point to have to deal with his shit.

I plan on quitting for good. Gambling has ruined me from a young age and I need to find something less destroying to do with my life.

Woke up dreaming about my last bet, which was a large one that could have dug me out of a massive hole. Multi thousand dollar bet on a 7 leg parlay. 5 legs hit, cashed out for 1/10th my bet amount. At one point early cash was 50% the total winning amount. Anyways, the one team was down by 3 and the other by 8 so I cashed. Woke up from a text from a friend saying withdrawl the money and never go back. Turns out both teams that were down came back, one from a 0-8 lead.... Would have netted over 50k. Even after that happened I continued to chase thinking if I got that close surely could again! Ended up putting more back. I know at this point I'm ranting but it hurts bad.

My life if falling apart. Substance abuse + Gambling addiction,"Hey everyone, this will be my first time EVER coming out and admitting that I have some serious problems. I am the man of the house and the main provider. My wife actually has a mental dis-order. I have a lot on my plate and feel the pressure daily....This has lead to down a terrible path. 2024 has been the worst year of my life. I have lost control of myself. I take Adderall everyday, I take multiple high doses of Kratom everyday and I gamble away thousands every week, since the beginning of this year.  I have never admitted to anyone that I have these problems. I have not told a single person, made a single post, or even attempted to get some help. 

I am a father of 2 young children. I have drained my savings accounts and 401K. I do still have some money left in the bank....just enough. I can't quit Kratom or Adderall otherwise I will not be able to carry on with my day due to withdrawals, but my kids, wife and job need me. I am supposed to be the strongest one and I am not. I am completely falling apart. I have lost 30 pounds in 4 months (that I did not need to lose). I have lost well over $80k gambling. Spent thousands on Kratom products while I still stake Adderall. I am stuck, I used to be a very strong minded and strong willed person. I used to be very motivated, I feel like the biggest piece of garbage right now. I need help, I need positivity, I need a plan, I need to quit this shit and be me again. I have not been me. I am losing who I am as a person.

Do i even want to stop,"Hey guys.  I quit gambling a few times a week, daily even sometimes.  The sad truth is nothing in my life seems more interesting than gambling.  I’ve been gambling for about 35yrs, since the age of 14.  Started small, progressed pretty fast.  Spent my summers waiting tables and would be broke usually by week 3 in football.  I live close to Atlantic city and casinos were a big part of my life but just bore me now.  Now i prefer to isolate in my home with ridiculous DK SGPs that have no shot.  I’m down about 100k in 8yrs with online sports books..I make good money, but i sometimes I work for free…100k in 8yrs not that horrible if you think about the average cost of a child per year…Hell i’m winning right?  Anyway, it’s not the money that really makes me sick anymore.  Don’t get me wrong i’ve grappled with those thoughts so many times when i spend my rent check at the horse track and had to sell furniture to eat…and gamble more..  It’s the feeling I get when i’m not gambling.  It’s complete and utter boredom.  I can’t do anything but pace.  Gambling shuts off my brain and stops all of the other thoughts.  I’m never more relaxed than when i’m staring at the TV or phone for that matter.  I often don’t even watch the games anymore..DK updates 30 seconds faster so that’s how i watch now.  Absolutely no emotion when i lose.  I used to get this way, heart would race, ups and downs..Now theres nothing…You know if i’m winning because i’m very nice to my fiancé and become talkative ….when i’m losing i won’t say a word and she asks why i’m so quiet..

Again, i didn’t used to be this way…I used to be a human being..Gambling has taken away my soul

I rationalize with myself how i’m going to chip away and try to win a few hundred a month…That lasts a few weeks and then i’m down a few grand…Chipping is boring i need chaos..

And the worst part is….College and Pro football are right around the corner and that’s all I can think about…Talk about a reservation…

Anyhow,  thought i would give this forum a shot…

·       I am grateful that I saw how anxious my ego is about the relationship I currently have with my son and its desire for the relationship to be perfect and something other than what it is today with its complications and uncertainty.

·       I am grateful that the antidote to this anxiety and doubt is realization of the truth of what it really is, full acceptance and trust in this truth, and ultimately letting these feelings pass.

Day 469: Life gets better,"To those struggling with a gambling addiction,

I want you to know that there is hope, even in the darkest moments. The journey to recovery may feel overwhelming, but every step you take away from gambling is a step towards a better, more peaceful life. You are not alone in this battle—many have walked this path and found freedom on the other side.

It’s okay to ask for help, to lean on others, and to forgive yourself. Recovery is not about perfection; it’s about progress, resilience, and the courage to keep going, even when it’s hard.

Remember that every day is a new opportunity to start fresh. The struggles you face today can become the strengths you build tomorrow. Believe in your ability to change, and know that a life free from the grip of gambling is not only possible but within your reach.

Keep fighting for yourself, for your future, and for the peace that comes with breaking free from addiction. You are worth it, and your story can be one of hope, healing, and a brighter tomorrow.

Stay strong, and take it one day at a time.

With hope and support,

Geoff

Day 6 after self-exclusion,"Guys and gals, I am happy to report tomorrow will be my 1-week anniversary of being gamble free.

Last Saturday, I turned $150 of free bets into $3000. Last Sunday, I turned $3000 into $0. Something inside me knew that the moment I went to sleep Saturday without withdrawing that money, it would be gone. And yet I went threw with it on Sunday. As if it was a lesson I had to replay for the final time. Because it sure as hell wasn't the first time I've done something like that. But the moment it turned into $0, I self-excluded from that site, and any other site that was available that allowed me to gamble my money.

I think I've been feeling some withdrawals. I haven't thought about placing a wager, or depositing, but I think it's withdrawals of the dopamine during gameplay. I've had flashes of thoughts and memories of anticipating the big screens on slots. And I've had thoughts about checking on an MLB baseball game even though I don't have a bet on it. To see how many strikeouts this guy had, or if that guy hit a home run. I didn't know if they were even playing, but searching scores and stats on my phone while I'm somewhere, at work, with family, etc. had become such a normal habit for me.

652 days gratefully without a bet ,"Today:

I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

I am grateful for 1:1 peaceful and serene bonding time with my wife yesterday. 

I am grateful she opened up about her childhood and her caretaker tendencies because of her father’s sickness and her willingness to be vulnerable with me. 

I am grateful that I could be with her, be empathetic towards her, understand better why she is who she is, and accept her for who she is and not how my ego wants her to be. 

I am grateful that I could be more vulnerable with her as well. It still takes a lot to let someone inside and really see me for who I am, but I’m making progress one day at a time. 

I am grateful that we were able to give my son the opportunity to spend 4 weeks at an overnight camp, and I will get to see him today for the first time time when we pick him up. 

I am grateful that I can see when I am superimposing my expectations and assumptions and judgements and anxieties and worries about his experience onto the pictures and videos I’ve seen his camp post with him in them. 

I am grateful to admit that I am taking emotionally biased and complicated memories of my own childhood summer experiences and inserting them into the present. Augmented reality! 

I am grateful that life is giving me this opportunity today to accept what’s going on inside me for what it is and let these memories go so I can fully accept todays reality and whatever my son tells us about his summer experience. 

I am grateful that I get to work on myself today and not waste my energy making trades and placing bets. I’m not going back to that gambling world of self destruction and self pity today.

Loops of torment ,"APOLOGIES VERY LONG POST I HAD TO GET OFF MY CHEST, MENTIONED SPECIFICS OF GAMES. 

27 years old M. Where to start…. Been gambling since Covid. Developed full addiction after breaking up with GF 4 years ago. I won a lot in the beginning like most of us and unfortunately (for a addict gamblers brain) have always been lucky, turning £20-£50 deposits into 4 figure and sometimes even 5 figure balances so many times it’s sad, anything that was cashed out was of course pissed away a few days after getting greedy and/or chasing that dopamine flood. I got myself into around 5K debt 2 years ago and successfully quit gambling and paid everything off and managed to recover my financial situation and move into my own place. 

I lasted a few months after moving out before letting my guard down and falling into that temptation, that tiny demonic little thought that just wiggles its way into your head convincing you that only £10 won’t hurt, completely wiping your memory of all of the suffering previously experienced. Yes of course I ended up winning from that £10 deposit and was single handedly plunged straight back into the abyss worst than before. After winning loads after relapsing and it never being enough, I lost everything and then I found myself gambling all of my wages every month AGAIN (this is last year) leaving myself with £30 a week to survive. By the skin of my teeth i was just about hiding it from everyone who knows me, isolating myself. It caught up with me. I got myself back Into 10K debt, then the cycle begins again. 

You know the craziest thing that’s developed is on payday each month I will literally wake up exactly as I get paid, give or take. Around 3:30am. My brain has been hijacked. No alarm needed, instantly awake give or take a few minutes and I mean AWAKE as soon as I get paid. Still to this day. Anyway at the start of this year I came clean to family after blowing rent money and whatever money I had for survival. 

An agreement was made to send my wages to my dad when I get paid. I am ashamed to say that every month this year I have sent him around £2000 when I get paid £3300 per month (I have been telling him that the rest of the money has been paying off debts, utter lies, my debts are barely being paid). So basically every pay day I relapse and fall into depression for a few days before self excluding from whatever site I’ve signed up to and making a promise to myself to ACTUALLY STOP and send him my full wages. But every single time this year it’s like a loop of temptation, losing control and mental torture. I reckon I’ve excluded from well over 30 sites now.

I’m writing all of this because I had my final straw 2 days ago (pay day). I’ll cut to the chase, woke up as soon as I was paid. Signed up to a new casino as per usual relapse. Deposited £100 and won £2000 played around 12 hours straight trying to level up- pathetic. Lost it all and made another 5+ deposits. After that I had £200 left. What I’m about to explain was thee most painful experience I’ve ever experienced with this addiction EVER the mixture of a good run and what can only be described as a punishment from god. I done 1 more deposit of £100 I ran it up to £900 and then started playing a game called crazy time. I was betting £100 on number 10 (my most degenerate moment ever). I done 9 spins and lost it all, I was sat there in disbelief when the very next spin after losing balance landed a 500x on 10. I just missed out on £50,000. I can’t explain that pain, I just cant. 
I had a final £100. At this point I was beyond defeated and to be honest just lost and dead inside. Once again I made my final deposit. Only to run my last £100 up to £1500 on slots and roulette over 4-5 hours. I then returned to crazy time for what reason I don’t know, other than being possesed. You’re not going to believe me. I was betting £25 on a bonus and my bet randomly got rejected. The bonus landed on 1000x. I broke some things. I genuinely lost my mind. I pretty much just realized then and there the extent of evil that gambling goes too. This is not where I am supposed to be. That pain was unmatched, it still doesnt feel real or possible. I see now that all the lessons I should have learnt have only gotten harder and harder. This is my final straw. It’s just so obvious that even if I won that on those bets it’s POINTLESS. In fact it could have killed me. It’s beyond bad luck for that to happen twice and I believe that is my warning, my slap on the face. The money has always been irrelevant, I have a gaping void. 

I will come clean to my dad about everything AGAIN. I will beat this because I have before. Only this time for good. I’ve experienced the essence, the pit of compulsive gambling. I know it starts with a choice. I pray for all of us going through it that we will overcome. We can. I can. You can.

Past week was a blur,"I was clean from gambling for several months after losing thousands earlier this year and thousands last year and thousands the year before. Last week or so I found a site that accepts crypto as deposits as I'm self excluded from most sites in my state. Started from gambling on some valorant games (esports) just to spice it up and add some thrill. Well proceeded to lose throughout the next week and here I am about $850 gone in a span of a couple days.

Okay with starting at Day 1 again.,"Yesterday, (Day 6) was the first day that I woke up and the gambling website was not my first thought.  I also noticed that I also did not wake up into an anxiety attack.  It was so nice.

My only reoccurring thought was that I had left a very small amount ($8) in my account on the gambling site, along with a possibility of some free plays.  It’s been driving me crazy all week.  Mostly the possibility of the free play money.

Late last night I decided to sign into the website and just get rid of it.  When I signed in, there was only $2.50 and no free plays.  I made a couple of bets to use up the money (now $.29 left) and signed out.   I had no intention or desire to put anymore money in.  It was odd the sense of relief in knowing where the account stands and that there no free play money I am missing out on.  Dumb I know, but I feel now like I can move on with a clear mind.

I woke up today in a small anxiety attack, and my first thought was that I had blown a week clean.  My next thought was, “but I am done, I really dont ever want to put another dime towards gambling”.   

I used to also have a gambling addiction to bingo, and one day, while I was playing, the same thought came into my head..”I done!”.  I left and never had an urge to play again.  I’m really hoping it works again.  Time will tell, but I am more hopeful for a recovery than I have been in a really long time.

YouTube, Email subscriptions, Live streams, apps, any way you have access to seeing people gamble or get sent offers. Self exclude from sites you use.

I’m grateful for the time to slow down and reflect. I see how unsustainable my life was going. I’m thankful that I can rest, reflect and rebuild a life I want. 

I’m grateful for this forum to see I’m not alone. I’m grateful for the help and advice I’ve received in addition to GA and counseling services.

I’m grateful that I’ve grown closer to God and am putting more faith into life working out, positively instead of trying to take control myself. When I was desperate or greedy, I made bad decisions.

Willingness is not a feeling or urge; it is a choice to open to everything in life, the good and the bad, including painful memories, emotions, thoughts, or bodily sensations. Instead of struggling against the negative experiences you do not want, willingness means accepting them without defense or resistance.

Or whatever you came into the room with you need to share.

651 days gratefully without a bet,"Today: 

·       I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

·       I am grateful that I’m learning how to handle difficult experiences.

·       I am grateful that I witnessed this morning how active and clinging my mind is towards the gambling dream it had last night.

·       I am grateful that I’m going through the process of relaxing, accepting that the gambling dream happened, remembering reality, and letting it go. My mind has compulsive addictive tendencies, and it will look to anything happening in life to justify going back to gambling. That’s just what it does, that’s just how it is. I am the one seeing it do this, and I know that neither the dream nor the subconscious thoughts behind it last and they don’t and won’t ever create any lasting satisfaction in my life.

·       I am grateful to recognize the triggers of compulsive gambling thought patterns and dreams that arose over the last week– the urge to check bitcoin and stock prices, my experience yesterday using Paypal  to pay a work consultant where I saw in a flash the opportunity to buy crypto,  the presence in my house of my father who reminds me of the dream world I created in my head in the throes of addiction around “having it all” like him, and the question my wife asked me about what to do about my finances if she were to die and I was on my own.

·       I am grateful for the realization that these triggers will come and go like everything else in life.  But just because I have those triggers, doesn’t mean I have to follow and act on them. I won’t, because I know how much better my life is today than it was 651 days ago. I’m not going back. And if I just let those triggers be and not make anything bigger out of them, I know they and the feelings/thoughts they trigger will eventually go away. That’s the way it is.

·       I am grateful for everything the Universe has given me– my health, my family, a roof over my head, a steady job, readily available food and water, and opportunities every day to learn and grow from each experience I have, even the difficult ones.   

·       I am grateful that I have self-respect and confidence again.

·       I am grateful for knowing who I am today and accepting me just as I am today. I don’t need to become someone else anymore.

There’s light at the end of the tunnel ,"I feel compelled to come on here and talk about my experience with gambling, as I am a compulsive gambler. Prior to Covid-19 I would controllably be playing poker online on my down time, maybe deposit very small amounts at a time which would last me a while - again just playing for fun. When Covid-19 hit there wasn’t much to do, and I was getting additional money from the government as our jobs were lost. My poker app introduced a slot category at this time which didn’t really intrigue me much but eventually was offered a free credit to play. It was around this time when sitting in the bathroom I hit a small jackpot. It’s money I have never seen before and in the coming weeks won another small jackpot. I had a fair amount in my account for the first time ever. The money lasted maybe 6 months but deeper and deeper I was dwelling into a void I did not see coming. Through and through all I was spending more and more time gambling, never falling into debt but also never had two cents to rub together. There would be moments of ups and downs but an extensive time was being wasted. I was keeping my habits in the dark and no one really knew. Fast forward a year I found myself in around a fairly large debt and was forced to work additionally in a factory, this when the gambling started getting out of control. I ended up taking a consolidation loan from the bank and one day at my other job I hit a jackpot. I made a promise to myself that I would quit gambling and enjoy my life again. About a month later I flushed everything back down the drain in the span of a couple days and was found in a desperate situation. I started to take my savings out and with a last desperate attempt signed up for a new casino which and I beat it once again, but that money didn’t last long either. 5 times I had redeposited and got it back up to the initial amount, once even getting it up way above. It didn’t matter, there was no stopping me no matter how many times I would win it back. I flushed my savings, lost trust from my family from coming clean. In the latter of my endeavours I would get high on hard drugs while gambling as I could not fathom what was happening at the time. I was so sick to my stomach I never wanted to place a bet again. The sheer neglect and disrespect, on top of everything how selfish and naïve I was on how this was affecting my loved ones brought me to my knees. My last bet was on August 8th of this year. I have made certain lifestyle changes such as not sleeping in anymore, going to the gym, spending more time with family, and most importantly going to GA meetings. Finding a sense of community among peers who all share their stories and have a common goal of perseverance made me realized that we are not alone. I was told that gambling is the second most addicting habit next to crack cocaine, more addicting than Heroin. I have had no urges to gamble and have taken extreme length to prevent myself as self exclusion wasn’t enough, I have limited my credit cards drastically so even if I were to relapse I wouldn’t be able to gamble much. People have asked me why I didn’t just withdraw the money and I realized at the end it was never even about the money, it was about the feeling of placing a large bet and the skepticism of the outcome. It is a disease that isn’t discriminatory to any walk of life, profession or gender. It is so soon from me departing from gambling that I can not say if I will ever relapse, however I don’t try and think so far ahead - all I can tell you is if I’m going to do it again, “not today”.

Day 6 - Casino Runs,"So if you read my first post I quit my job in December to travel all of 2024. Well getting into gambling half way through the year destroyed my budget. Lost 22k in Potential winnings hours before my return flight to US. 

Well now I’m doing Uber/Lyft at nights to make some extra cash while I’m looking for my next move. 

I prefer doing it over night. DC has decent amount of work over night and no traffic. Well the bad thing is a lot of these are people going to and from MGM national harbor. 

Did 4 casino runs the other night. On the 4th I had to pee really bad. Went to the restroom. Then I thought “I need to stretch my legs, I’ll just walk around casino floor”. So I did.  

Seeing all the games I watch my favorite YouTubers play(some I hadn’t seen in person yet). Then I watched a full BJ table where dealer kept losing. I thought “what’s 40 bucks”. I go to the ATM. Withdraw. Beside me an older lady is withdrawing 500 bucks. Something about that just hit me. I sit at the slot and I couldn’t do it. It’s the first time I really people watched at the casino and looked at the faces. 

Walked out with my $40 and used it for the nights’ gas. Funny thing is there was a guy who was playing by the door when I came in. Since I was leaving so fast he goes “cmon man you ain’t lose it all that fast”. 

Told me nah. I won something. Although this isn’t a test I can pass every time I’m proud of myself.

$19k gone. Need to change my life.,"tldr: lost $19k in the span of 5 hours. decided to self exclude myself from everything and start my day 1 of recovering from my crippling gambling addiction

Here is my story if you’re interested:

Started gambling in university, at first it was just small sportsbets here and there to add some entertainment to my life, but it quickly consumed my whole life. I would spend 4-6 hours a day watching my bets unfold, reading up on other peoples picks, searching for the next big dopamine hit. I wish I could say that was the lowest point for me. Once I started becoming addicted to online slots and table games, it became a steep downhill descent.

Slots were the ultimate dopamine hit for me, the potential to win hundreds and thousands always kept me hooked. My wagers started from a minimum of $20 and skyrocketed to a peak of $1000 per wager. I remember each massive loss so vividly (-$8k, -$4k, -$10k), but a few miracles here and there allowed me to salvage most of my losses and hover around break even. Despite the massive highs of winning big, I was never winning against the casinos in the long run, but my delusional self kept saying “one more big win and I’m done”. This was the lie I fed myself to justify my gambling addiction. I always chalked it off as an “entertainment fee”, but when the losses become unsustainable, I found myself in temporary patches of depression and self-loathing. I’ve hit rock bottom twice in my 3 years of gambling and each time I would delete the apps or initiate a cool off period on the apps. Afterwards, I would have weeks or even whole months where I was responsibly gambling and only wagering small amounts at a time. But these grace periods never lasted long and everytime I relapsed, I relapsed extremely hard. I would tunnel vision and chase a loss for hours and days at a time, losing sleep and neglecting my other responsibilities. I’ve successfully chased my losses dozens and dozens of times, but all it takes is one bad day and I will burn through thousands in a futile attempt to break even.

Today was one of those days and is officially the 3rd time I’ve hit rock bottom. I spent 5 hours chasing a couple hundred dollars and ended up losing $19k in this one sitting. All I have left to my name is a couple thousand in my bank account instead of $20k+. This was money I needed for school, for food, for rent, and for tuition. All wiped away in a matter of clicks and hours. I don’t know where to go from here and what to even feel, my brain is still racing and processing the magnitude of what I’ve just done. This is the last straw for me, I simply can’t keep this up.

As I’m reflecting on my life, I can’t help but feel depressed and borderline suicidal. Gambling has ruined the last 3 years of my life and I have so many regrets. All the countless days and hours I wasted playing slots and sportsbetting could’ve been used to improve myself, achieve real-life goals, and focus on the people in my life that I care about. The part I hate the most is that I have noone to blame but myself.

As of today, I’ve officially self excluded myself from every single betting app I’ve ever touched and deleted them all off my phone. While I’m still depressed about the financial and mental toll gambling has taken on me, for the first time in a while, I feel a renewed sense of purpose in my life. It’s going to be extremely difficult dealing with the financial losses I’ve incurred and I’m not sure what I’m going to do, but right now my number one priority is starting this journey of recovery that many of you are currently on right now.

That being said, I’m open to any advice or resources that those of you found helpful",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1etmopy/19k_gone_need_to_change_my_life/,23,24,1723808986,

Drinking is a trigger. Financkal stress is a trigger. Environment is a trigger. Lack of confidence is a trigger.

I don't know if I will relapse again, I certainly feel confident I won't but I have the knowledge to keep things in check if I were to slip.

It does get better and if you relapse it's just part of the process. Pick yourself up and keep moving.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1eswzxi/new_milestone_6_months/,6,2,1723733025,
649 days gratefully without a bet,"Today:

I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

I am grateful that I am better able to admit when I’ve made a mistake and accept the intense feelings of vulnerability that come with it.

I am grateful that I saw yesterday how habitual feelings of inadequacy and unworthiness surfaced yesterday when my son continued to write to his mother from camp and not me.

 I am grateful that he has a loving and trusting relationship with her.

I am grateful that I saw these same feelings and thoughts arise at other times yesterday, and that I saw myself snowball and then overeat and engage in heavy self destructive sense indulgence last night to soothe myself. 

I am grateful that I’m remembering reality today - that I don’t have control over other people places and things, I don’t know why my son hasn’t been writing me or why other people do what they do, and that’s ok, even if my ego is screaming at me to insist otherwise.

I am grateful that I see the conditions that bring out self destructive thinking feeling and behavior within me, and that I accept the challenge and the journey to relax, accept, and transcend/ let go of these conditions, one day at a time. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1esvpqx/649_days_gratefully_without_a_bet/,6,2,1723729873,

Can't stop gambling ,"Hello. I am still suffering from a problem with gambling, especially the casino, since 2018. After I sold my house and then got into a very serious problem with one of the moneylenders, and thanks to God I survived it, I returned about two months ago to playing a lot, and most of the money is through debts from friends, and the losses accumulate above and beyond. Some of them are: My head hurts a lot from feeling insulted by the request for money and the amount of debt that I have accumulated. Most importantly, I have a family that has already been affected by this.

25M - Gambling Addiction,"Hello all

I started gambling from the first week of turning 18
Right away I was hooked, and almost everyday over the last 7 years I have gambled.

I have had times when I had half a dozen payday loans at once, times I was behind on rent and lost my apartment.. and times where I wouldn't eat for days on end.

All this to support my gambling habit.

Most recently to shock and horror I won $100k.
That's 2 years of my wages.

I have lost all of it, within a week.
Stupidity..
Absolutely stupid.

To think sometimes I'd be so broke and playing .20¢ bets with my food money..
Last week I was playing $50 spins.. and upto $4000 roulette spins!?!
How could I even do this to myself.

I lost everything, I lost the only chance I was given to take it and run, this addiction and foolishness, it is like nothing else.

My last few dollars was gone today, just never again can I do this, how, what is wrong with me..

Or me now 24 regretting even depositing that day as it has literally fucked me over massively from a time prospective of saving’s and me just wanting to other things that don’t revolve me sitting in front of screen gambling that I have been doing for the last 6-9 months.

My 1 year UK self exclusion is coming up for me to renew it. But in the last 6-9 months I have been gambling on a certain crypto casino using a VPN and got extremely lucky which makes me always come back to gamble their. 

I have won more than 200k from gambling alone in the last 6-9 months not as a lump some but from me consistently having good sessions but the luck ran out and I couldn’t stop myself from depositing all the money I had and still can’t.  

The worse thing about it is that I only probably spent 10-12 k of it and majority of that 10-12 k went to family members. Don’t tell me what I could of done with it because if I were to win any figure of money I would gamble all of it away with my current relationship with gambling. 

My bank closed my account because I’m assuming they thought I was committing fraud which it is and I never disclosed were all this money was coming from because they never asked.  

I have had 7 sessions of gambling therapy over the phone which has shun some light on my relationship with gambling. 

I’m lucky I’m not in too much debt 1 pay day loan and 1 credit card I maxed at 18 from gambling and I’m lucky that my rent is cheap as I live at home still

Failed Arbitrage Plan,"With the equity I’ve built on both DraftKings & FanDuel apps, I figured I would take a break but utilizing generous boosts & promos to hedge both sides of bets in hopes of building account back up after frenzied chasing of losses over the past few months. It worked for a few weeks but the itch for more kept creeping back. Sports betting has become a lot of my personality & has with core groups of friends. It’s hard to completely stay away so mentally I’ve had trouble abstaining completely and lose the community aspect of “betting with the boys”. I’ve proven to not be able to control limits and it’s been getting progressively worse over the last year. I’ve failed many breaks, failed many “take both sides” bets on different books & am finally at the realization that I have a legitimate problem. I’m aware of the unwanted mood changes. I’m disgusted at myself for the financial buffoonery. Blowing paychecks to bet whether or not the SF Giants get Over 0.5 Hits in the 4th Inning is not somewhere I would be despite pretty much everything in my life being in place. Good job, strong marriage, balanced portfolio. It’s just the thrill of winning or the close call losses that had me hooked. I’d say 75% of my bets are live bet - quick swing plays. It’s gross & obviously a horrible proposition as far as betting value. I’ve loved sports all my life & am having to have a lot of tough internal conversations with myself. I fear my relationship with sports has gotten so out of whack, I don’t know how to move forward. I need to stop betting altogether.

Day 120,"Day 120

Holy shit 120 days without gambling. 120 days of choosing myself. It feels wild to say I haven’t gambled in 120 days. 

Looking back 120 days ago, I never thought I could ever go one day without gambling let alone, one day with relying on someone and something to make me happy or distract me from all of the underlying issues I had going on in my life. 

When this journey started I didn’t think I deserved to be happy, I thought I had to and would live in this mindset and montage of misery forever. 

All it took was finding the mindset, strength and courage to over come all of this. I decided to focus on my mental and physical health. Choose everyday to put one foot in front of the other and not let anything stop me from reaching my goals. 

I struggled a lot, nothing came easy. But I never went back to the one thing that would numb the pain that I was going thru. 
I’m not going to lie and say I never thought about going back and hiding from my feelings and the world again. But with the help of therapy the people who checked on me everyday. The best friend who I met online the person who I cried to, laughed with, the one who everyday made me think more than I had thought in years. Taught me and make me realize I am worth more than I was giving myself or letting people give me. I got on a plane and traveled half way across the country to meet. 
Finally I was actually ready to open myself up to saying again. I was happy with myself and proud of myself. And now know I have a lot to offer. I laid everything out on the table from the beginning, was extremely vulnerable, was terrified when I was doing it. But it was the most authentic way I have ever started a relationship. 
Being happy with myself let me open myself up to the relationship I always wanted and deserved to have. Instead of hiding all my insecurities and feelings. I now know I can come to him and ask him for help. Having someone who is supportive and pushes me to be the best person I can and want to be is new to me. And damn it sure feels amazing. 

So here is to the next thirty days! Pushing myself, achieving my goals, and loving myself and everyone around me.

Here to break out the hope of winning on slot machine.,"Hi guys!!
Today i was curious about the probability of max win from the game i played in the past. 
And at the same time, im here to show you, why having hope in gambling, is useless... And its a very big trap ! 

1. Sugar rush, max win is x5000, 
The probability of max win is 1 of 2,34 million of spin.
And winning x1000 or over is one of 37 900 spin on average. 

2. Gates of Olympus, max win is 5000x 
The probability of max win is 1 of 714 000 spin. 
And winning x1000 and over is 1 of 40 xxx spin. 

I have another exemple but... Just to show you that you can expect to win after spending a lot lot of money. 

Instead spending your precious money by playing, put it on the side, and do better things with it. 

Casino always have the biggest piece. You cannot beat them. Maybe you can be extremely lucky, but dont forget that of 1 player wins, maybe 10 000 player loose everything.

To going more deeper, if i play for exemple sugar rush,
I got 20$ in bankroll, and i bet 0,20$ stakes... 
Which is give me 100 spin on that game without winning. 

And, 100 spin of 2,34 million of spin or 100 spin of 37 900 spin, is still extremely low!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1erp2xv/here_to_break_out_the_hope_of_winning_on_slot/,12,4,1723599155,

Day 464: Recovery is possible ,"Everyday you choose to abstain from gambling is considered a win. Recovery is not one size fits alls. Everyone’s recovery is going to look different.

Build or join a community of humans ( I say humans because we make mistakes, we’re not perfect, nor should we try to be. If anything we should try to be better than we were the day before). Seek out professional help with therapists, specifically gambling addiction specialist. If sports are a trigger, find something more productive to do than sitting around on your phone, watching sports.

I need words of encouragement right now all I can think about is the hole I fell back into. I’m so pissed at myself for this I hate myself and I fucking hate gambling so much.

When it gets better,"The worse part for me is when you have not gambled for a few months and you have paid off some of your debts and suddenly you have the urge to gamble. 

You dont feel that horrible heart sinking feeling that we all know when you go to deposit after some big losses. You know how well you are doing, and that you are only going to bet small amounts. It usually starts off with a easy 20 or 50 euro deposit.

But it never ends up being just that. You will either win big, then lose it all, or keep losing, and keep depositing until you are back at zero. 

Self exclusions don't work as there are millions of casinos. The dopamine highs are comparable to drugs. Its truly one of the most evil things.

If you can take anything away from this, everytime you have the urge to gamble, look at this reddit. Look at all the people reaching rock bottom everyday and having to live off scraps until payday. I genuinely hope, with the bottom of my heart that you rid yourself of this horrible, horrible disease.

$50,000 in a night. I make close to that in a year after taxes. Wow. It was great. Anyway I spend the weekend gambling with my buddy. Win another few thousand. 50k+ in my checking.

The Sneaky phase...,"So like the last relapse or every other relapse before that I am now at the (what I call) ""The Sneaky phase"".

Like when you are feeling good again, being more productive and socialize more that here and there a thought pops up in your mind that a little bit of gamba isnt that bad and ofc its going to be different this time around!

My delusional brain is like this:

""Okay this time around we just go in with a small amount like 50€ (all relapses started like this) and if we loose we just go in again with only 50 € next month (lie) and should we win we cash out and buy something nice with it (lie).""

I will just loose this 50 in prox under 5 minutes then go and empty my bank account :D

but the scary part is that these thoughts FEEL so convincing like you think or feel that you would have it in control this time but thats never never never gonna happen. I somehow need to cement that in my brain.

Day 1 after a big win,"I’ve posted here before and in no way a week ago I thought I would be posting about quitting, yet here I am.
I had a pretty big win 2 days ago (tried a lil bit more to play with more lmao, didn’t win more) and ironically, that was my sign to stop. Why, some may ask? 

Like probably most people here, my first big win was  the thing that started my addiction. It was a feeling I couldn’t describe or compare to anything. However, we all know what happens after a big win and how you feel invincible. I won so much, what’s 1/2 of that if there’s a possibility to win even more? After all, I wouldn’t have this money to begin with if I wasn’t gambling, right? 


A couple of weeks ago I started giving all of my money to my boyfriend to save for me because it got to a point where if there was even a cent in my account, it would go straight into slots. Thankfully, that’s what I did with my win also - had to come clean that I was still gambling, sent it to my boyfriend and it went untouched. Won some more, lost it (obviously). 

But it got me thinking - I’ve had 6-7 “big wins” over the 2 years I’ve been actively gambling. The big wins are the casinos making sure you always come back, and boy we do. But what happens between those big wins is straight up misery, losing money, losing half of my day every day when usually in every other aspect of my life I’m flourishing. It just isn’t worth it anymore. I’m about to be 27 years old and quitting is something I want to do for myself that I genuinely believe my older self will thank me for.

Also, this sub has been amazing and reading your stories has been so helpful. It’s great to know we’re not alone in this and everyone shares similar experiences. Also, people who have made it past day 1 - I’m so proud of you! You are all doing amazing.

How do you cope with the anxiety when facing debts?,"Have quit and relapsed several times over the past 2 years. I managed to rack up a debt that will require 2 - 3 years to clear off. D7 clean today, and have no urges to go back to gambling anymore. However, what keeps me up and anxious every night, is the fact that I will not be having extra cash for personal savings nor have the luxury to spend on things other than necessities until I settle my debts. I cannot stop comparing myself with peers around my age (20s), how they are advancing in their lives - building their savings, buying a house, etc. On the other hand, I kept going back to gambling within the last 2 years and pulling back myself to debts, halting any progress to advance in my own life.

It doesn't help when my closest family member is diagnosed with cancer recently and our financial burden further increases. I thought about how great life would have been, if gambling never happened to me. 

I'm really having a hard time coping with the sheer anxiety due to my gambling debts. Understand that time would heal and things will get better, but it is really easier said than done.

Today is 8 years of abstinence from gambling.,"8 years ago, I was screaming at the top of my lungs in my car completely baffled at how I was 20k in the hole, couldn’t physically control my body enough to stop gambling, planning to wrap my car around a tree and end it all. 

On my way out of the parking lot, I saw the 1800Gambler hotline number and thought, what the heck and someone was kind enough to answer and after talking with him for a while, he met me at a gas station near the casino, bought me a sandwich and filled up my gas tank. He listened to my story and I cried into this stranger’s arms. It was the first time I had felt real gratitude.

He asked me if I was ready to quit gambling and I told him I had a “system.” He told me that all my past thoughts and decisions, clever systems and scheming had landed me where I was and that I could choose to do the same thing over and over again, or I could choose to do something different.

This disease had tricked me into thinking that I didn’t have a disease.

I desperately wanted to do something different. He told me to meet him at a GA meeting across town. I told him it was too far. 

He asked me how far I had traveled to go gamble. I could not argue with that logic. 

I met him at the GA meeting the next day. I was miserable, skeptical, and fearful. I didn’t want to be there, but I stayed because I felt that I had no other choice.

I felt that if this didn’t work, that nothing would. 

I stuck around. Felt hope and love and understanding from the people there. They shared about how good their lives were without gambling. They shared about how their lives had been so messed up and their situations sounded similar to mine.

Went out for fellowship afterwards and felt like these people actually cared about me. 

I kept going back to meetings.

My GA journey hasn’t been perfect. There were times when I stopped going to meetings for a while and almost ended up back in the casino. 

I was still an asshole to others. Was riddled with guilt. Lived in so much fear. 

I didn’t get a sponsor to work the steps until about 3 years ago, but that is when my life dramatically began to improve.

I started working on my character defects. Adopted new ways of thinking and behaviors that I never practiced before. 

Currently, my life is better than it has ever been. I do not live in fear, but in faith. I feel good to be of service. I have made amends with the people in my past and the guilt seems like a far away dream. 

The biggest thing for me is that my negative thoughts are so small compared to before. I no longer ruminate on how bad things are, but concentrate on what I am grateful for which motivates me to do the next right action. 

I am not perfect, but I am progressing and I love my life.

Sex life changes,"Hi everyone,
I (27F) am a spouse of a gambling addict (27M)who was gambling heavily for about 1.5-2 years and recently stopped after he came out about his addiction. I have a really embarrassing question but I don’t really know who else to turn to other than people who may understand what he’s going through. So we’ve been together for 7 years and we used to have sex a lot(new relationship and we were younger) but when he started gambling I defiantly noticed our sex life decreased and he didn’t seem as interested. He was never not interested but was more tired and obviously very stressed (I didn’t know this at the time). Well ever since quitting he has had such an increase in his sex drive, not that it’s a bad thing as we have been reconnecting more. I’m just wondering if he is using sex to distract himself or if he is genuinely just returning back to his former self. I’m just curious of other people who have stopped gambling, did you start engaging in any other behaviours?

How to talk to my dad about his gambling problem,"Hi! I´m not sure if this is the right place to ask, but i believe my dad has a gambling problem. He never has any money, hasn´t contributed with house expenses for the past few years, and borrows money from my mum, sister and other members of our family. He has his own business and always blames his customers not paying him for his money problems. He started going to the casino before Covid and it was a bit of a problem, but nothing major, with lockdown this obviously stop, or at least we thought so.

Last week one of his suppliers came home asking about him (He owed him money), and mentioned that he called him and the people at the casino answered the call and said he had forgotten his phone there. He leaves the house in the morning everyday and works until late, and never answers the phone when we call him in the morning, he waits and returns the call.

He is almost 60 and stubborn as hell, but this is affecting my family and me, as i have to pay for everything in the house and can´t move out as i´m worried my mum won´t be able to pay for services or even afford food. I don´t know how to bring it up or how to help him, he hates discussions of any kind and always runs away from hard conversations. I don´t want to resent him and i want to help, but i really don´t know where to start.

I am genuinely not a good person man. I hurt people around me and i can never ever ever do anything anymore to deserve te attention or respect they give me.

I started gambling after i left the military. Money was never in surplus so i started gambling. Not anything special but always losing sometimes a win. 

3 years later i’m in a debt of around €80.000 
- loans 
- paycheck 
- business money 


I lost money 6k 1 week ago to buy a car me and my dad won at auction (we are in the car business). He was asking me why the payment is so late and i told him i don’t know. Today i lost another 4k from my friend. I told him i was going to pay him back tomorrow. 

When i lost the 4k from my friend. I tried to wake up my girlfriend and asked her for 6k to pay a “car payment” she told me she don’t have thar kind of money but she would give me her last 2500. 

It broke me man like really fucked me up now…..i don’t deserve her man. 

I tried meetings but reading a book on how to know if your a gambler does not really help with me.

My gf and I got in a fight because Ive been playing for 10 hours and she wanted to go home and I couldn't stop. Started tilt betting on baccarat betting $1K at a time, losing in blackjack, etc. And lost 4.3K to be down to $7K having a net loss of $3K. 

Just an absolute rollercoaster of emotions today and how gambling can be so dangerous. 

I'm only 24 years old and quite frankly this is a lot of money for me and you know its a problem when you look around at others at the table, and you're betting the most every single time. 

High card flush game is terrible, don't ever play that garbage. Never ever see anyone win in this game. Blackjack is terrible when the shoe is terrible. Just loss after loss after loss. It's like the dealer had a impenetrable freaking force field where she could never lose even if I have a 19 or 20. Never ever play blackjack with other people at the table. Got so mad when this lady didnt split her 2's against a 6. And dealer ended up getting a 21, when in reality she would of busted. Had a huge bet on it too that would of changed the course of my day. 
Baccarat is also absolutely terrible. Its completely unpredictable, trends are absolute bullshit and im saying this as an asian person that should be loving baccarat. DO NOT PLAY BACCARAT YOU WILL LOSE EVERYTHING, Especially if you try to implement martingale strategy. Don't even get me started with American Roulette where the house edge is ALMOST 6%. DON'T even attempt. Every $100 you bet, you lose $6 dollars in the long run its ridicilous. 

The one game that saved me from losing absolute everything was ultimate hold em and I do believe its helpful when you have a friends next to you showing their cards to you. However I know that this game, you will most likely lose in the long run. 

I feel like a depressed blob right now. My head hurts. $3K is so much to me, my gf is pissed at me, etc.. Today frickin sucks man. I have very low motivation for work tommorow. And I have an insatiable urge to go back and try to win it back. 

Should I just self exclude from cherokee casino? I wont ever have access to the wsop poker tournaments there, i wont be able to go restuarants there, etc.. No more free hotel rooms.. Should I just stop it all? The thrill of winning is so good, but should I just stop? What will I replace this gambling addiction with? Im decent at poker, but absolute shit at table games. I will never have the chance of winning a tournament at wsop in cherokee if i self exclude. 

I've lost $62000 gambling overall, and im only 24. Its just disgusting, absolutely just vile.

"dear self, read this when you feel like gambling again!!","i just realized that the time that i was most tempted to gamble is when the money is tight. that’s also the time where i always fuck up cause at the back of my mind, i was kinda hoping for some cash to win so i can have extra cash but ofc as a dumb bitch, i always lose.   


i feel numb. i hope someday i get back all of the money that i lost in this stupid addiction, not through gambling but by working. i swear i will fucking stop today. i will always remind myself that there is no good in gambling cause house always wins. I can never beat the system and i am just being one of their cash cows. i am so cheap when it comes to spending for my wants and needs but when i am gambling, money feels like paper that doesn’t have any value. I will always keep this is in mind, i swear.   


reddit has become my outlet for my gambling frustrations so maybe you guys will see my posts more often from now on cause i am planning to post whenever i have temptations. Or maybe i will just re-read my posts so i will be reminded of the negative feelings that i got from losing money from gambling.

I need your wisdom,"I've been sober for over 6 months now and have managed to recover financially and, to some extent, mentally. I went from being dead broke back in November of last year to having a little over 12000 euros in the bank as of today. To achieve this, I moved to another country to get a better paying job, and I stopped gambling. I cleared my debts. It's a nice feeling (although a powerfully bittersweet one) to see that kind of money in your bank account again.

Despite all this, I've been feeling the itch to gamble again for the last few days. I didn't think I would again, given how determined I was to escape my former life.

And yet here I am. I need you guys to help me stay on the right path and deter me from falling down the rabbit hole again.

What a shitty disease.,"*note: please take it as a vent away, I absolutely mean it with my recovery.

I was doing so well, went on a amazing holiday with my gf, I was doing well at my job that I started to like… well till I wasnt… I was all alone for 3 days in my house then I
 deposited that 20$ I guess out of pure boredom… deep down knew that I was going to f*** up but the devil was too convincing It felt like I was just sitting in the back of my head watching myself destroy what I had build:((

well… fast forward 3 hours, chasing that small loss cost me 2 monthly paychecks:(

Already did the last thing I always didnt want to do… 

I shifted my finance maintenance to my girlfriend so whenever I need to pay something online her approval on her phone is requested so I made another roadblock …feel like a shit of a man but its a neccessary step now as I cant manage my own money. Especially when I make more than I used to and the root to this relapse is probably that I wanted to pay all of my debt at once… thats what we Gamblers do.. we want everything asap.
Thats our nature, thats our doom

What an absolute abomination of an addiction this is! Like even if you eventually get out and you are bet free for a year or more you actually HAVE TO watch yourself thinking about placing a bet, triggers, to find a distraction in a bad mood, take it 24h a day and constantly know that it didn’t dissappear. Always lurking somewhere in the shadows like a nightmarish demon that it is. I am sick of this.. lol pardon my negativity I am on my day  4 and I am still upset about my last relapse, so I hope it wil eventually go away… Last time I lasted 134 life was really getting better so the recovery is definitely worth it.. but you get the point right? 

What I mean is that I cant think of a better analogy that this is the true cancer of the soul… never gets away= in remission
And when you let it spread its eventually over:( Once again I wish all of you a lot of strength, we need it

Day 1 - self exclusion,"Today I gambled an amount I had no business losing. I turned it into a much larger sum. And proceeded to think luck was on my side and gave it all back after getting frustrated that the hot streak wasn't continuing. 

I decided to self exclude, because I have done that same thing countless times. A person without a problem would have withdrawn that and thrown it towards the one-year-of-net-earnings debt I got myself into. Not me. I have a problem. I self excluded from that forsaken online slot casino, as well as those sportsbooks that I placed lottery parlays on and track live stats of a baseball game I had zero interest in other than a wager.

2 years is how long it will take to be debt free. Almost a full year of my net wages will be used to pay interest. I'm not proud of myself, or my actions, or how I let myself be consumed by this gambling addiction. But I am proud that today I took the first major step in recovery.

Day 0 - > Ready to move on,"Grew up frugal and living a simple life. Never thought I would be in the position I am in now.

I never understood why people would visit casinos, gamble.. as we all know house always win. 

Fast forward to WFH during COVID and a close friend introduced me to a fun pass-time. Sports betting. 

  
I went home that day, downloaded BET365 and was ecstatic to win the quick $20-$30. Thought I would give the online slots also a chance, but found myself hooked. Whatever I lost I put more in to win it all back. When I did, I would just proceed to lose it all again. 

Deleted my account once my loses hit $6K, only to open account with LeoVegas and repeat. At this point, the constant loses took a toll on my health. I found myself awake throughout the night and my family was surely taking notice. 

I was single, spending time alone and the eco-system of gambling was becoming my comfort. Going to the casino in person was a vibe until the walk back the car, knowing I spent a paycheque. 

Luckily, after switching jobs and returning to the office the gambling has significantly reduced. Sadly, this month I relapsed and found myself losing $8K.  I told my partner of what happened, although she has been very understanding I do feel awful for being in the situation. 

Being in the casino for all those hours, being near people yelling at Slots, smelling their BO but remaining seated next to them, never hitting a jackpot. Having my partner with me a few times, having her see me in that state of ""wanting to win it back"". Then today seeing my checking account in overdraft for the **first time ever.**

  
I am ready to move on. In the past I felt like I was completing a choir by quitting but this time I am excited for my future away from this wrongdoing. I can't change the past but I can build a simpler tomorrow.  

  
I don't want scare away my partner and I don't want to pick up any debt. I have self-excluded for online gambling, and the casino in-person is awful. I am blessed that I have a great job and very solid stock portfolio that I can recover even after the $60K grand total loss over the last 4 years. 

Not many get leave this disease on a safe & calm note, but there's no better time for me to stop than now.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1epcv2g/day_0_ready_to_move_on/,4,0,1723353045,
645 days gratefully without a bet,"Today:  
·       I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

·       I am grateful I was able to attend a friend’s going-away celebration and see old friends I haven’t connected with in a long time.

·       I am grateful for the time spent in the car driving to and from because it was fulfilling 1:1 time with my wife, even when it was silent.

·       I am grateful that I was applying what I’ve learned in GA and from therapy to yesterday’s social experiences. I’m not as social as I used to be, so each moment when it does happen is a learning opportunity.

·       I am grateful that I experienced more feelings of shame, self-resentment, and inadequacy yesterday – its evidence that I still have stuff to let go of.

·       I am grateful that I’ve also seen how influenced these feelings are by my body’s reactions to what I eat and how I sleep and that I saw how my mind’s rationalizations this morning to what I was feeling came after the body reactions. It was only almost like my mind saw my body’s reaction to bad Mexican food and poor sleep as the Trojan Horse to keep spewing the same bullshit self-destructive narratives and find ways to use my disorientation and discomfort inside to trick me into believing them.

·       I am grateful that relaxing inside and letting go of mental garbage really helps simplify life and pushes me towards full unconditional acceptance of me and with life.  

·       I am grateful to accept that life plays out the way it’s supposed to play out. Wishing it would be otherwise is like saying that I know better than all the collective wisdom and experience and causes from billions of years of nature doing its thing, and that sounds crazy.

·       I am grateful for the opportunity today to send prayers and blessings of loving kindness and healing to a friend who is in the hospital dealing with a problematic pregnancy. I really feel for her, but I also know she has the strength to carry through.

644 days gratefully without a bet,"Today:  
·       I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

·       I am grateful that my wife is home.

·       I am grateful that I can support her and her family as they handle this situation with her sick uncle.

·       I am grateful to see through meditation that I still have repressed memories inside about people making fun of me for how fat I was and how hairy I was.

·       I am grateful to see that these memories are just as much about memories of my own self-loathing thoughts and feelings inside from when I was a kid, and today avoiding the potential pain of facing them and just letting them pass.

·       I am grateful that I’m now taking responsibility for my inner state, which means learning how to handle these moments and memories, recognize them for what they are, and letting them go.

·       I am grateful for my therapy session yesterday, and the insight that my tendency to overeat and overindulge to sooth my pain and run away from my emotions likely is a result of being overfed as a baby. My mother likely fed me whenever I cried to calm me down, and my mind and body were conditioned at that early age to feel soothed when my belly was full.

·       I am grateful that I can forgive my mother for doing this, because I know she was only trying her best, and I’m sure she was likely having the same feelings I had as a parent when my son was upset and I felt completely helpless.

·       I am grateful to know now that today, when I start asking myself whether I’m still hungry or if I should keep eating after a meal, I know that’s the time to stop. That doubt is my mind trying to trick me into continuing this self-destructive thought pattern and behavior.

·       I am grateful for the other big insight from yesterday’s session. My habitual urges to gamble, eat, and act compulsively recklessly and obsessively, especially at the end of the day, are likely a reaction to how controlling, stressed, and judgmental my inner ego is to me throughout the day. The urge to think “fuck it” and act on that thought is my mind trying to trick me into believing that it’s ok to engage in self-destructive thoughts and behaviors because it needs to balance out.

·       I am grateful to know that the better path for me is to let these thoughts and urges pass, and focus my inner energy and effort on letting go of my addiction to everything my ego has to say in the first place.

Had a ""sports pager"" one of the books provided to check scores. It was no use in the air so I flew with great anxiety because I had 38.5k at risk with the juice on 7 NFL games. 

So plane lands and scores appear to my chagrin. 2 wins and 5 losses, so during the 4 hour flight I became $17,500 poorer, and had to smile 😃, thank the flight staff, and pretend life was great upon my disembarkation!

Explaining to a non addict,"Hello. I'm Shawn an I'm an addict. I don't gamble, however. I am addicted to opiates. I wanted to ask if anyone could explain to me if downloading ""free play"" apps like fake slots and fake blackjack is triggering or therapeutic or neutral?  I'm asking because I fooled myself into thinking if I quit hydrocodone and just switched to weed I wasn't doing anything wrong. Yada yada you all understand the feeling of needing to feed the beast. We just have different beast to feed. But the chemistry in our brains has to be similar because we're addicts. Even something as taking a benedryl is triggering to me.

I stopped at the best possible time.,"I (M19) decided to quit gambling for good last week. I've been gambling religiously since I turned 18. When it started I would put £5-10 bets on sport and would win a few and lose a few and would be content either way. When I started I always avoided games because I knew enough about house odds to know that it was stupid. I never had huge wins (max £100-200). Over the past 18 months, the habit grew to putting much larger bets. I would occasionally play online casino games (which I would lose and feel shit about so would walk away after one loss). 

In the last few months as other aspects of my life deteriorated (breakup and increased substance abuse), the gambling naturally got worse. As I'm paid weekly I found it much easier to piss away everything I earned week after week. It became much worse after I moved into my new flat which was far more expensive and was living in my overdraft. I worked out very quickly that the less money you have, the more willing you are to gamble and it got to a point where I was relying on wins to live off. I started playing a lot more games: the one I found most addictive was Slingo because it was only 20p to start the game and it always looked like you were going to win and I was winning a fair bit off them. I'd also play slot games like Fishing Frenzy. I knew it was getting bad when I would win jackpots and still be down (an issue I had never had a few months ago). I was under the belief that I was just one deposit and a few spins away from making it out of the hole and being able to pay my rent. I would sit up until 6, 7, 8am every day making small deposits.

One night I realised I had spent my entire overdraft. I looked over my bank statement and the endless transactions of -£5.00 and -£10.00 to various sites just made me embarrassed. This was midweek as well so I was unable to spend any money for the rest of the week. I had to walk 45 mins each way to work because I couldn't afford a bus fare or Uber. That was when I decided to put myself on GamStop and self-excluded myself from all online sites. After that, I took money out of other places (long-term investments I had set up months ago) to live off. I'm so glad I did that after I decided to stop as I would've ended up using all that as well.

I'm grateful that I stopped before it ruined my life. I'm at an age where I can learn from my mistakes and don't have other people relying on me. I'm grateful that I never borrowed money from my friends or family. I'm grateful that I stopped 2 weeks before rent is due, as if I waited one more week I don't know how I would've paid it. 

When my self-exclusion ends I'm going to extend it because I know that it will all start again 6 months down the line. I remember what gambling addicts were telling me when I had it under control: **the more money you have, the more you will gamble**. And they were right, I just learnt it the hard way. It;s the worst addiction you can have. I can stop drinking when I've had enough and I can stop sniffing coke when I want to go to sleep. Gambling is different because you hardly notice it until it becomes a problem. It's crazy how it's only been a week and I already notice the difference in my mood and how much more money I have than usual.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1enprul/i_stopped_at_the_best_possible_time/,5,0,1723174581,

A Strategy to Stop Gambling Forever (and not switch to another addiction),"If you’re struggling with gambling addiction and feel like willpower alone isn’t enough, you’re not alone. Many people find themselves trapped in a cycle of highs and lows, wondering why they keep returning to gambling despite wanting to quit. 

Here’s a strategy that might help:

Gambling addiction often masks deeper issues like stress, anxiety, unresolved trauma, or negative self-beliefs such as ""I'm not good enough"" or ""I don't deserve happiness."" The thrill of gambling releases dopamine, providing a temporary escape from these painful emotions. Even the pain of losing can serve as a distraction from deeper emotional pain, much like other forms of self-harm.

To break free from this cycle and do the deeper healing work, it’s crucial to first minimize the need for willpower in the meantime by limiting your access to gambling. Here are a few practical steps:

1. Limit access to funds – Set up barriers that prevent easy access to money.
2. Use content blockers like Gamban – Block gambling websites and apps on your devices.
3. Get a non-smartphone – Downgrade to a basic phone to avoid temptation.
4. Self exclude – Ban yourself from as many gambling sites/ venues as you realistically can.

While these might seem like band-aid solutions, sometimes a band-aid is necessary to stop the bleeding before you can heal the underlying wound. Therapy can then help you uncover and address the root causes driving your addiction, transforming negative core beliefs and leading to lasting recovery.

TL;DR: block access to gambling; heal underlying issues.

But for android device, everything is open source. 
And you can install APK files direcly from brower. And off course, they already have an APK version !! 
And they work on way more aggressive blocking version with this APK installation .. so it will prevent you to trying bypass gamban.

People come from all over the world to participate in the Olympics, and they come with a wide range of talent. A lot of them know they will not win a medal, yet they have trained hard for their event. They meet people from all corners of the earth who love the same activity.
There is a contagious joy and excitement the athletes share in their time together. It is a sense that the sharing of worldwide joy and peace is indeed possible.
Whether we succeed or fail in what we do is not the essential thing. What is important is the heart with which we live our lives.

Day 1 - My insight on what makes us act against our best interests,"For the last 12 days or so I've been suffering from a pretty severe sinusitis that i got after catching Covid. Because of all symptoms and needing to add another bunch of meds into the stack (decongestants, antibiotics), I thought it would be better ""healthwise"" if I stopped my ADHD meds (my own stupid decision). Then, two days ago after a severe FOMO episode, i relapsed. And managed to double my debts, which is around 50k now.

Sometimes i believe that, besides an untreated/undiagnosed mental health condition that causes an IMPULSE CONTROL DISORDER - such as bipolar mania and/or ADHD -we suffer a lot from some wishes. Actually, there is a common motif between most of them.

You can read many posts and find that the theme of being able to go to the past and making it differently is not an uncommon Wish.

That, as we are talking now between our sober (not-intoxicated by gambling prospects) selves, it means JUST GOING BACK AND NOT GAMBLING. And, frequently, we find ourselves wondering about it.

HOWEVER

This same will of doing things differently (in other words, reality-rejecting), while on a semi-allured brain, might also play the part of ""picking the other choice"" on roulette; of being able to stop while on profit; of choosing the another number; of shorting instead of longing the markets. And we find ourselves wondering about these things, too.

So, there comes the insight.

In our unfortunate situation of potential mental health issues (adhd / mania) plus unproperly connected and wrongly trained ""goal-accomplishing"" brain networks, we must stop wishing. 

Besides treating our brain chemical imbalances, i believe we need to mindful to not reinforce some firmly ingrained behavioral paths that could eventually act on one's disfavour. We need to endure this fcked up situation stoically, because if we insist on these ""chasing wishes"" we only help to reinforce what will ultimatlly bring us down, which is often paired with Fear of Missing Out (FOMO).

While we not rewire our brains, we must keep vigilance on our thoughts and feelings, either by one or both means

- meds that may improve your self-control (in my case, im back now to Strattera, that neatly manages my Adhd)

- intense support by a family member / significant other who can actually limit your access to cash and financial matters.

In my case, I only have the meds, my family refuses to fully manage my accounts even after i plied for their help. They gave me ""functional independence"" (whatever it means) and this is enough to sign for more loans just to burn it down.


TLDR - Dont think about alternate realities. Of what could have been. Related or not to gambling, dont reinforce this pathway on your brain. Simply move on and try to be braindead about money, potential/actual gains and potential/realized losses.

Reinforce other pathways on your brain, such as what you should be grateful for. Also, distance this kind of thinking from the idea of money.

If, despite of this, you keep finding yourself unable to maintain enough self-discipline, research about impulse control disorders (Adhd and/or bipolar mania) and get them treated ASAP.

Gratefuless is the only remedy to the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO):

I recreated a gambling site game in Python to prove that you can NEVER win.,"Hey everyone!

Just wanted to share my findings from running some simulations of Stake Dice in the Python code that I created. It proves that no matter what ""magic"" strategy you see on YouTube or another site that you will ALWAYS lose.

These are the ranges you can expect to fall in when just flat betting after simulating tens of millions of rolls. AS you can see, eventually you will lose no matter what.

When taking a look at using a Martingale strategy with a starting bankroll of $1,000 and a starting bet of $1, this is how long it took each of the 100,000 players I simulated to lose all $1k. EVERY SINGLE PERSON lost all of their money eventually.

How are gambling facilitors better than drug dealers and pimps?,"Just like drug dealers and pimps these people are exploiting the weak minded and people with addictions and profiting off their miseries, legal casinos have been fined before for giving people drugs, alcohol and other various things so they can further impair their judgement and financially ruin them, in order for them to pay for the 1 billion plus casino they built they need to have us all lose a bunch of money, they can claim that gambling is entertainment all they want and gamble responsiblly, but let’s face it a bunch of their profits comes from degenerates like us and whales who bet big probably more than they can afford to, if a guy overdosed on fentanyl the world goes apeshit, but what about all the people who off themselves after losing everything and than their wives and kids?

I have lost a little over 50,000 and have nothing to show for it. I keep all my expenses in check and even though i hate to see all the money lost on gambling i can´t stop betting. I tried everything: siteblock, closing accounts, self exclusion, but i always find a loophole to start gambling again. Via another page, going back on the self exclusion, you name it.

I really dont know what to do, there have been times where i achieved not to gamble for 3 months straight and then 1 day i gamble and lose much more than in the last 12 months

i know that i am an addict but i dont see any way out, there have been countless times i reassured myself that this was gonna be the last time i gamble but it never seems to be true.

Tho it didn't helped me, because when gamban told me if I installed the software I can't uninstall it, my brain hijacked me and told me: Not even poker in the weekends? I can't do it. But maybe you can.

641 days gratefully without a bet,"Today:

•⁠  ⁠I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

•⁠  ⁠I am grateful for the gratitude group I’m in and the accountability it creates within me each day to keep remembering what I do have vs. dwelling on what I don’t. 

•⁠  ⁠I am grateful for realizing that I can only know and be responsible for my inner state. I can provide experience strength and hope to others as best I can but, ultimately, I need to respect them, what they’re going through, and let them live their life and make their own life decisions as best they can.  

•⁠  ⁠I am grateful for the inner strength that is growing within me. 

•⁠  ⁠I am grateful that I’m trying not to run away from painful feelings and thoughts anymore. 

•⁠  ⁠I am grateful that each day, I am making progress, even when it feels like I’m not, because I know there’s so much value just in the act of trying. 

•⁠  ⁠I am grateful that there are good days and bad days. That’s just the way life is. Better for me to accept it and embrace the bad days and moments as learning experiences than believe in my mind’s delusion that life should only be about the good days. 

•⁠  ⁠I am grateful that what in the past would have felt like a terrible day that I would have freaked out about inside (getting stuck in torrential storm, getting drenched on commute home, leak in roof), I didn’t freak out inside.

I’m done tho I banned myself from everything and I’m going to chargeback even tho I shouldn’t and it’s illegal. It’s the best way to never again make an account with the online slots since your ID and address becomes black listed so what’s the point of playing if you can’t cash out right? It’s the small urge and a bonus hits then I’m hooked. I’ve always worked hard but I have almost nothing to show for it. But after banning  myself I feel the weight off my chest like I was broken out a cage. Now I don’t have to worry about when I get a big check cleared to take it out before that urge hits in an again. I’m 23 gambling set me back years. I don’t gamble in person. I know I’m going to lose so why take the 30-40 minute trip to go lose. But the online slots man the free play the discounts. I feel like I’m back I feel normal again. I used my girlfriend as a savings afraid I would spend my money I was great and investing my money wisely until the addiction hit I had a 780 credit score I ruined the great run I had and now I have to start over but I feel great. I’m not the type of person to come on Reddit and type stuff like this but I know you guys understand and it makes me feel comfortable it’s soothing.

I am 21 and I have a big gambling problem. How can i get banned on hellcase?,"Hey. I have been dealing with this issue for a while now, probably 6 years. It started out with opening cases on csgo at around age 15. It was very innocent until I started using my mother's card without her permission. She eventually caught me and I felt horrible. I did not know that this would be a problem at the time. Eventually i turned to cs gambling sites, underage ofc. It was nearly impossible for me to not use these sites. All the youtubers I was watching was at some point promoting these sites. It was so easy to get access to these sites because all you had to do was sign in with your steam account and thats it. I would spend hours gambling and alot of money. I eventually turned to online casionos and that really had me in a chokehold. Whenever i got paid I spent my whole paycheck in a couple of days and I was broke. I didn't have the heart to tell my parents about it. I had to tell them in the end and it felt really good to talk about it. They were very supportive about it, I told them i didn't want to go to therapy at first but i couldn't stop gambling so i went to therapy. It worked for a while, I managed to go 3 months without gambling and I felt like I had made it and I was happy. I have recently started gambling again. I have been using a site called hellcase, it is a csgo gambling site. I had banned myself on pretty much all online casinos and cs gambling sites but not hellcase. I have tried contacting support before and they told me they can't ban me because it goes against their guideline or some stupid shit. I have asked them again recently and they said the same thing. This really pisses me off because I have told them how much im struggling and they won't do anything. Have anyone else experienced this or found a way to get banned on hellcase? For me I think closing this website will be very beneficial for me and help me get back on track.

DAY ONE ,"Throw away account for obvious reasons. For context I am a young man in his mid 20s. These are meant to be the best years of my life but instead they've been clouded by dispair, self loathing, guilt, shame, embaressment and lies. All of which have stemmed from the never ending hamster wheel which is gambling addiction.

I cant handle being stuck in the same place, sinking in quicksand, whilst everyone i know is moving forward in life so, after many failed attempts and numerous attempts of help from others, I have finally decided to take steps towards beating this addiction. Ive been living a life of lies for FAR too long and i feel like i have finally hit rock bottom. I cant help but feel relieved in a way because if I keep going the way I was then I would probably end up dead. Sounds dramatic to say but i have been driving myself insane for years. 

My story is probably like many of yours, I gambled, got myself into debt, got bailed out, gambled again, accumulated more debt,  took out loan, gambled again, borrow money from friends, then gambled again. Its demoralising. My girlfriend knows about my problem and has been the most supportive person ever. She has helped me so much over the past few years and is always there for me but I jsut take her for granted. She recently found a letter concerning a loan which she didn't know about. She thought I had been sober since January so she was obviously shocked and had a lot of questions. I had to hold my hands up and finally admit to what I had done. My life is a mess right now but I think this has been the wake up call ive needed. She deserves so much better than to be woth someone whos an addict. this is the last straw, she said that she cant do this again and I completely understand but idk how I would live with myself if i lost my bestfriend over soemthing so degenerate as gambling. So, I gues this is day 1. We have had a lot of deep talks over the past few days and shes called me out on all my lies. im just lucky to be given one more chance. 

This disease is the worst thing in the world and has turned me into a disgusting person and definitely someone i never imagined id be. it has turned me into a compulsive liar and a fraud and I am sick of it now. time to make a stand and get back on my feet. I have blocked all my accounts, self excluded, downaloaded gamban, and I am going to start seeing a therapist soon so I can get a better understanding of my triggers. I am hopeful that I can make it work this time and I am so determined to change. I want this more than anything. 

Not expecting any replies or comments, I jsut had to make a post to look back on during the tough days. Time to work harder and build better habits. We can't let this addiction beat us . #stayhard #debtfreesoon

24 years old lost about 20k gambling this year,"Hi everyone, currently about 25 days bet free. Had good luck gambling at first which started my addiction. Like most of us know, the wins only keep us coming back. Long story short, it destroyed my mental health and personality. In the last year I wagered a little under a million dollars gambling every second I could. Small bets for fun turned into thousands in minutes. Currently getting help through GA which really helps, also going to church as well. I am trying to show awareness to the new generation of gamblers and to tell them they are not alone. For me it was chasing loses, even if I got my losses back I would still not be satisfied. At this point I am chalking it up to fun and a expensive life lesson. I love to play but see it as very unhealthy and stressful. I tried to quit multiple times with multiple relapses. I then saw my friends were a big part in my problem. They were a bad influence because they talk about sports betting and going to the casino all the time, but they don’t have a problem. They would go to the casino and lose 200 dollars and be done while I’m playing thousand dollar hands of BJ. I since had to distance myself from them and focus on other hobbies and finding healthier relationships. I asked them to not talk about it in front of me but they continued to do it. So maybe if anyone else is experiencing the same thing it’s really worked for me and don’t think about gambling as much.

To cut a long story somewhat short I've been with my partner 2 years this October coming up and around 4, 4 and a half months ago things all came out in an ugly fashion when I was terminated from work because I'd been stealing to fund my gambling addiction.

(I have mixed feelings about that word when it comes to this problem of mine. Don't get me wrong that absolutely is what it is, it's what I have and I am a gambling addict... but I wish it had the same visible effects as other addictions. Perhaps then I wouldn't have been able to hide things from every single person in my life for so long. But unfortunately it doesn't so I was able to mask it until this happened.) 

It shouldn't have taken it coming to that for me to have realised things had spiralled so long ago, before this happened I had stole from friends and family and caused both a great deal of hurt. I think in a way the very serious potential implications were what I needed to help fuel my recovery, because I'd crossed a line at some point where consequences didn't seem to matter in the moment. It's as if when actually doing the gambling, I'm just a spectator on my life in 3rd person view, doing things I know I shouldn't be for reasons I can't understand. I admitted that I had a problem for the first time. 

Despite it all my partner stuck by me and I began my recovery journey. In the first week, I'd self excluded myself from every avenue it's possible to self exclude from, I'd began looking for new jobs and also applied for income support and most importantly I contacted NECA and then on their advise also, referred myself to talking therapy from the NHS. 

The in person sessions with NECA were one of the most helpful things I have ever done. My partner attended most of them with me and her support during that time of my life is something I will never forget. Then there was the follow up online sessions, which by contrast I personally didn't find beneficial as it felt more like a check box exercise, someone was merely reading from a script. This may be helpful to some of course, but I don't feel like it added or took away anything from my own recovery journey. Recently though I'd been put on to a different peer support online group at NECA which I am immensely still looking forward to the first one, to be talking to people who have been through the same or similar things. To know I'm not alone and I'm not the only person who has had this horrible problem. 

In the time since A and B I found a new job... being able to contribute towards the bills evenly again felt immensely satisfying and I was proud of myself, my partner was proud of me too and that made me so happy. If I'm being completely honest I hadn't even thought about gambling. I felt I had a real drive to focus on my recovery and I was trying to implement everything I'd learned in the talking therapy too about looking towards the future and being less focused on ruminating, which I had been really struggling with in the early days of my recovery. I was focusing a lot on my family and on my new job. 

Lapses and relapses are something of course I covered with NECA and I truly believed I was confident in myself about being able to deal with any urges. The only problem being that I wouldn't say up until this past Saturday I actually had any urges. For over 4 months.

Then like a car smashing through a wall there it was. I HAD to gamble and seemingly it didn't matter where the money came from and I'm ashamed to say I stole from my partners savings tin, something I had never done before, a line I had never crossed, and I had lapsed for the first time since my recovery started.

There was no in between from this not being on my mind at all to it being the most intense feeling you could think of. I have such a loving partner AND family AND friends who all would have happily helped talk me out of this urge, had I only called them. Instead I stole from the person I love and I can't comprehend that. I cannot understand why I would do that. I had been doing so well in my recovery and we had been doing so well as a couple and as a family (I'm a step dad to her son who I think of as my own and he thinks of me as a father). I've placed all of that in jeopardy now. 

I'm at my parents house while my partner processes this, I know this news will have broken them also. I know I may yet be kicked out and left because of this and honestly who could blame her if that's the decision she makes, absolutely no one. I plan on replacing the money I took when I'm next paid and I know she believes me when I say that, but that doesn't make a difference, not really, I still took it in the first place and I don't know how I can ever justify that to myself, or how I ever did during that lapse. 

Which leads me here. I'm going to call NECA in the morning, because I need some kind of system for if this ever happens again and as much as it pains me to think of what may well happen now I still need that system in place whatever my partner decides.

I will NOT go back to the life of gambling I had, it was every day, it consumed me. I refuse to. I have come too far in such a (relatively) short space of time for one lapse to destroy everything in my life, even if it turns out it has destroyed my relationship with my partner and step son, which I feel is inevitable now. 

Update at time of posting (since I wrote this last night). I have called NECA and spoke to my councillor and got myself booked in for a face to face. He seems to firmly believe that this experience can be used to solidify my recovery and be learned from. At this moment in time that's a hard pill to swallow and I'm struggling to believe I'm anything but a complete failure and disappointment to everyone who is close to me and that I always will be.

I haven't heard from my partner, but I don't imagine I will for some time. She needs to process this all properly and I need to give her the space to do so. 

I have been completely disowned by one friend and I can't blame him for that, everything he said to me hurt and it hurt because it was true. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1elekeq/a_recovery_journal_day_1/,1,1,1722941182,

Day 456,"🌟 Struggling with a gambling addiction and ready to make a change? Here are some essential tips to help you break free from the cycle and reclaim control of your life:

1️⃣ Admit the problem: Acknowledge that you have a gambling addiction and understand the impact it has on your life and those around you. Acceptance is the first step towards recovery.

2️⃣ Seek professional help: Reach out to therapists, counselors, or support groups specialized in treating gambling addiction. Professional guidance and support can make a significant difference in your journey to recovery. Check out my previous posts for a link to the “Compulsive Gamblers in Recovery” discord. 

3️⃣ Block access to gambling: Limit your exposure to gambling triggers by blocking online gambling sites, avoiding casinos, and staying away from environments that encourage gambling behavior.

4️⃣ Develop healthy coping mechanisms: Find alternative ways to cope with stress, anxiety, or boredom that don't involve gambling. Engage in activities that promote relaxation, such as exercise, meditation, or hobbies you enjoy.

Remember, recovery is a process, and it's okay to take one day at a time. Be patient with yourself, stay committed to change, and believe in your ability to overcome this challenge. You are not defined by your addiction, and there is hope for a brighter, gambling-free future ahead. You've got this! 💪  #YouAreNotAlone

When did you cross the line?,I have recently realized that I have crossed “that line”. Small wins aren’t enough. Low bets aren’t satisfying. A big win is not a reason to leave and take profits. The atm machine will be used until I’m maxed out. Credit cards are always there for backup. Anything short of a huge win will surely guarantee a painful loss and it didn’t use to be like this. I crossed that line where it is and can no longer be fun or a part of my life or I surely will be in for pain and disaster! ,https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1el3zon/when_did_you_cross_the_line/,1,1,1722904306,

"Help, how do I deal with the shame, self-hate and disgust??","My story: I never gambled more than $25 before. Just the occasional Super Bowl pool and such. Then about 3 months ago, I started to bet small on DraftKings. I went through the usual, predictable cycle: won a little, got cocky, lost a lot, then bet more to make it back, then lost more, and more and more, chased losses....fast forward three months later, and it spiraled out of control, and I lost almost $120,000. I am not a rich guy, so this was a huge part of my family's life savings. I have an amazing wife and a beautiful little boy, and I let them down. Now, on top of the losses, I learn that I will most likely get hit with a huge tax bill on my ""winnings"", probably around another $40,000 (during this nightmare screw-up, I ""made"" about $500K, and lost about $620K. But some states have messed up tax laws, and they charge you tax on the full winnings, and ignore the losses).

I am sick to my stomach, I can't sleep at night, I can't eat, I can't concentrate on anything except the grief, sadness, and fear that I caused my wife. I don't know how to make it up to her, I don't know who to talk to, there are no meetups in my area, therapists that I tried calling through my insurance company they don't even pick up the phone, or they say they aren't taking new clients...

I am at the lowest point in my life, I have never done anything like this before. And now it's too late to turn back time, how do I make it right for my wife, if that's even possible, and how do I not feel like this, so ashamed, depressed, self hating....for the rest of my life?",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ekvqsy/help_how_do_i_deal_with_the_shame_selfhate_and/,7,32,1722883781,

One drink lead to another and next thing you know…all credit/debit cards maxed out 10k in the fucking hole! I’m so hurt, feel so stupid all I had to do was stay away!

I dont lie but i cant tell my friend this :(. She even was tempted to contact my parents yesterday because she knows i have a big problem with gambling. So now 800 loss total in 3 days.  Lost 2k begin of the year too. And maybe a few thousand in 2023. Its too hurtful for me.

I tried to stop since years ago. I got restricted from all casinos in my country. I can still gamble on illegal or crypto casinos. I tried browser extension. I now also did stop my VPN so I cant use this to gamble. I removed my solwallet from my browser.

This is not the only 3 days I gambled.. I hate my life. I was jobless for a few years but this week got a new job. Which probably made me gamble more knowing Ill get salary.

I slept so bad last night and still yesterday I promised myself and friends I wouldn't play anymore. I now put some crypto away in a wallet and won't do anything with crypto anymore too. I need to grow up.. im 30.

Im not in debt but its not like I have over 5000 euro... living with my parents.

I never told them I have problem with gambling :( I hoped I was able to quit but its so damn hard. I dont have a gf, im lonely, I dont like life.. yeah, like most of us we are dissatisfied with our life. Fk it. 

Please dont gamble guys. I hope I can stop and feel peace in my mind. I hate being moody to my parents or people now too.

639 days gratefully without a bet,"Today:  
·       I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

·       I am grateful to admit that I briefly lost it yesterday when the coffee mug fell and broke my phone.

·       I am grateful that the entirety of the process of going from accident to resolution showed me both how far I’ve come in my journey and what I need to work on.

·       I am grateful that my wife dropped everything she was doing to help me. I’m continuously inspired by what seems to be her instinctually selfless nature.

·       I am grateful to admit that I was once very jealous and resentful of her because I saw her as such a good person while I judged myself as a POS.

·       I am grateful to know now that this was just bullshit evidence that my mind made up to support the bullshit narrative it made up about my permanent unworthiness.  

·       I am grateful for the experience last night and this morning of worrying about what’s going on in the markets, feeling the fear of future loss it created within me, and experiencing what used to be a habitual emotional reaction that triggered and reinforced the cycle of my compulsive gambling behavior.

·       I am grateful for the process of learning daily how to fully accept and recognize the emotions and feelings and thoughts inside me for what they are and remember that they are not permanent, they are not certain, they are unfulfilling, and they most definitely are not me.

·       I am grateful to admit that my mind’s tendency is to reject emotions and feelings that don’t feel good inside, but the evidence in my life shows that rejecting those emotions doesn’t make them go away. It just buries them deeper and makes them harder to process later.

·       I am grateful to admit that its still quite a mess inside, and that’s ok, that’s what it’s like to be human, that’s what it’s like for me right now. It is what it is.

·       I am grateful that accepting and letting these feelings and emotions and thoughts pass without getting involved seems to be a healthier way to process what’s going on in life than denying that they are there in the first place or clinging to them unhealthily.

Fast forward to now decided to play slots online again lost a bit won a bit, ended up winning a great sum and all the wonderful thoughts come flooding back, all of the things I can do with my gains, and this time I have the hindsight of my previous fuck ups so this time I will be different ill take my winnings and run. 

Oh how wrong I was started small just a little bit of it back a couple hundred here or there, and before I know it I've blown through every penny chasing losses, telling myself the big win to bring me back to where I started is just around the corner one more deposit, the win it's waiting there. But no of course it isn't it's all just one big delusion playing a game against a computer than knows my habits, and has a set programme designed to take... But of course my brain just assumes it will come through why wouldn't it. 

The constant mental gymnastics justifying every deposit oh just another X amount and if that doesn't work I'll close my account and stop, but reach my threshold and low and behold I've decided to move the goal posts a little bit further away. Forever changing whatever I've said my bottom line is to something more favourable to my gambling. 

Just another stupid chain of decisions resulting in the same result. Who knew repeating exactly what I've done in the past would result in the same thing happening. 

Fuck this snake like addiction and all it entails more than likely not my last time making a charitable donation to a casino but who knows maybe this time is different. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ekf7lk/just_another_story/,5,2,1722832862,

Considering dropping out of college due to having no more money,"19M

Because I lost $5000, and I am going to college in foreign country where I cannot get a part time job because I am a simply a foreigner, I might have to drop out.

My parents, since they are not financially stable, will not be able to help me with the lost $5000, which is from the rent money they gave me in advance.

If I drop out college, it will be more difficult to go back to college in my country, and I will possibly get a disadvantage when doing job seeking.

But in a situation where I really have no money left, I have no option here.

I cannot get loans here because in my country, banks wont borrow you money if you are under 23 and did not go to military yet, and even if they do, it will have very high interest rates.

I lost the $5000 because I kept buying and selling the same stocks to make a profit.

I bought unprofitable domestic stocks, especially a superconductor stock that turned out to be a scam.

I also kept buying and selling NVDA right before it went up in the earnings.

I shouldn't have spent a whole month wasting time on stocks, otherwise my life would have been way better.

I went to $5000 because I was trying to chase after a $300 loss.

I feel so stupid and I still cannot accept that I will have to live a more horrible life.

I feel like the world isn't fair to me, because my life went from peak to the very bottom.

If I drop out of college, I will have to stick with minimum wage jobs for the rest of my life, and my parents might completely cut me off after this incident.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ek5t2o/considering_dropping_out_of_college_due_to_having/,8,7,1722805287,
Day 455: Hope for better days are in sight ,"If you’re struggling with a gambling addiction, there’s hope for better days. Recovery is possible. I, myself have nearly 455 days under my belt and I can tell you each day away from gambling is a win, hence the name: Winning Daily. 

1) self exclude- ban yourself from in person casinos, easy access apps and anything you use to gamble. If/when you decide to self exclude, consider lifetime ban. If not, when the exclusion is lifted, you’re right back to gambling again and end up in a similar situation as you’re in currently. 

2) give up access to money or bank account: for some of us, seeing too much month at the end of our money could be a trigger to gamble and think we double the money in our bank account. I’m here to tell you, that’ll never happen. You deposit that money, or get loans and use credit to gamble, next thing you know, you lose it all mindlessly gambling. So if that’s a trigger, let someone you know such as a family member or very close friend keep watch of your bank account and help keep you accountable. 

3) Get a community of people behind you. Preferably other human beings who know that same struggle you’re going through. 

I created a discord server for all those struggling with gambling addiction and are looking to make a change in their life. Within the virtual halls of this Discord server, members find a sense of camaraderie and understanding that is often lacking in their day-to-day lives. Here, individuals from all walks of life come together to share their experiences, offer advice, and lend a listening ear to those in need.

One of the most powerful aspects of the ""Compulsive Gamblers in Recovery"" Discord server is its emphasis on empathy and non-judgment. Regardless of how dire our situations may seem, members are met with compassion and encouragement rather than condemnation. This culture of acceptance fosters a sense of belonging and empowerment, empowering individuals to confront their addiction head-on. If this seems interesting to you, or you know someone who has a gambling addiction and are looking for help, here’s the link: https://discord.gg/d5NgC4nZ

4) with most addictions, there’s an underlying issue that needs to be addressed. This isn’t just gambling addiction but with most. The best way to address those issues is with professional help with a therapist. Consider seeking out professional help to conquer your addictions

Stay grinding, stop gambling. Life gets better. One day at a time.

Regaining the Value of Money: Seeking Practical Advice,"Background, in my twenties living and working in London. I have recently lost £10k in the past week through spread betting and sports betting, and over £200k in total throughout my life. I am not here for a magic pill or the usual advice to simply ""stop."" I fully understand that perspective and, believe me, I have heard it countless times.

Right now, I feel completely out of touch with reality when it comes to the value of money. It is bizarre how I won't spend £10 on lunch because it seems too much, yet I'm comfortable wagering £500 on a single tennis point without a second thought.

My question is, how do I regain a proper sense of the value of money? I've tried rationalising it by thinking about how much time and effort it takes to earn back the money I lose. For instance, at an average rate of £20 an hour, it would take months of solid work to make back that £10k (which believe me I am truly disgusted by. Alternatively I could make £1k in 10 minutes if things go my way). Despite understanding this logically, I still find myself detached from the real value of money.

I'm seeking practical advice or strategies that might help me change my perception and regain a healthy relationship with money. Has anyone else experienced this and managed to overcome it? What worked for you? Any actionable tips or methods would be greatly appreciated. I want to start a business or something. I feel I am also losing touch with social connections, I struggle to converse with people even on trivial things.

At the beginning I started betting, in sports betting and so on, I started winning and losing, but nothing out of this world. Until the excitement was no longer the same until I reached large amounts like $250 dollars, which for me was a large amount at that time, at school during recess, I liked to see what to bet on, and that no matter what bet I won and it was like that for a while until one day I remember losing and putting all my money in a game, that's right all my money I had nothing else in case I lost or to buy lunch, go out to party or something similar for those who were They ask, I won, and I kept betting until I won $4000 dollars, which I lost in 1 night, yes, one night, it could be a lot or a little, but for me it was an amount that very few people win even a month, I continued and continued with relapses and increases Everything was very strange and frustrating, he treated people badly, he was a son of a bitch to tell the truth, he lied, had a bad mood and other things, I even had an operation and I remember betting with fear that my family or friends would realize that I was betting. While I was on the stretcher, I lost more money, I never bet more than I had, I know it's not something to brag about but I think it's an advantage, anyway I continued betting intermittently for 1 year with ups and downs, self-exclusions on occasions and so on. , I remember that every time I went out to party I thought, let me bet so that the outing is free and like that, I work and it doesn't go well or badly for me but I am fortunate enough to not spend much, I don't earn much but I spend almost nothing, another climax point was when I recently met an incredible, attentive, beautiful girl, I am very lucky that she is my partner and I am proud of our relationship, I remember one time gambling and I don't know if out of mere revenge or frustration I tried to cut her off and then regret it, I promised to quit and I left it for 30 days or something like that, time passed and I didn't do it very often but one day some friends and I went to a casino I started with $60 dollars and ended up losing over $650, not only that but it had ruined my peace of mind , I remember waking up at night thinking about everything, and lastly yesterday as soon as they paid me I spent it and it should be noted that this is not the first time this has happened, but well I just wanted to vent, I will soon go to the psychologist, I am not broke nor have I spent all my money but peace of mind is very valuable, I would like advice",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ejosja/my_problem_gambling/,1,0,1722753354,

Help!!,"I need help. Its easy to gamble, no matter where you are, what time it is, theres a chance to win loads of money!! Deposit into a betting site press a button and spin, spin away always thinking the next spin, next deposit might be the BIG one (it never is) sometimes I win which is great I sometimes even withdraw winnings, but I just bet most of it back, thinking I won on that site, now let's try this one! I am a mother of 4 and over 40 years old i am so ashamed to say I gambled almost all of my wages, after winning nothing I checked my bank balance, almost 0. I had just got paid and hadn't even paid any bills yet.

I called my dad shaking, crying, in pure panic and told him gambling had been leaving me short for months, and yes I only told everyone ""won 200 last night"" but never the amount I'd bet over numerous sites. All my credit cards are maxed and charging interest, im in arrears with every bill i have - some i just avoid contact with. He said to stop feeling sorry for myself and take control, its only money and he is always there to help me out (he's not rich by any means) He sent me a link to gamestop to prevent me logging into any UK betting site, I registered with that. He said he will not give me money to help me put but will use his credit card for me to buy online groceries, or buy me things i need and pay my important bills online with his card and I can pay him back, which I am so thankful for. I was also addicted to an online competition site, I put myself in time out on that. I downloaded a few games on my phone and when get urge to gamble play them and enjoy when I complete a level and get a reward.

Did I learn my lesson? - NO!! Within weeks im in same position, can't bet on slots online granted but I just joined another competition site, won some but spent a fortune (...just another 10 tickets). I recently got a very high interest personal loan for £1000 to ""get me on my feet"" (not that it would - thats a splash in the ocean) it was spent in days on nothing. To be honest I can't even afford to pay the loan back.

I feel disgusted with myself!! Its the same reason I eat junk food even though I'm overweight. I know its damaging but can't help myself in that moment. I also spend too much on takeaway food. What is wrong with me??

I even had to dial back my most favorite hobbies as I no longer have much cash available for flying lessons. It's just brutal.

Why can’t I stop?,"I’ve been doing so good. I’ve been saving like I need to be. I haven’t been able to drive my car for at least a year because I’m considered “high risk” and have to pay 6 months in advance (minimum 3100). I had around 2,500 and my ignorant self has considered trying to “win” a little extra every day, and unfortunately I’ve given in multiple times now, totalling around $300 loss in the last two weeks.

I could’ve had my car back on the road multiple times, and if I wouldn’t  have done this, with my pay next week I would’ve had enough to get everything going.

I know your all probably laughing at how little my loss is compared to others, but I am truly addicted and am fighting this hard.

The urge to self sabotage ,"4ish months ago I had my most recent day 1, I still haven’t relapsed but man the urge is there. Got a few emails from a shit online site I was using before where the self exclusion period had apparently run out, considered having a play, remembered its a shit and dodgy site and closed the account. 

The thoughts were there then though, what about the decent UK sites, with the good games, I could just have some controlled fun on there, lift the ban, put limits in place. I even went through the steps to get into my gamstop account, telling myself I can control it now (despite the last 15 years showing I categorically cannot). 

Thankfully they rightly don’t make it easy, you have to call, you have 24 hours cooling down, just what I needed to curb my impulsive urge.

Thoughts are still there though, still whispering away, just £50 a week, what’s the harm…? 

Coming on here and reading posts is helping keep me honest with myself. I haven’t changed since my post 3 years ago, 1 year ago and all those failed day 1s in between, I will not control it, and I absolutely don’t want to go backwards into more debt when I’m still paying off my last binge. 

To anyone that hasn’t self excluded yet, do it, it’s a big scary step but it’s the only reason I am not sat writing about how I lost everything again last night. 

Good luck everyone.

Day 2 ,"I started at the beginning of 2021, I think, I had never felt as much emotion as those days. At the beginning I started betting, in sports betting and so on, I started winning and losing, but nothing out of this world. Until the excitement was no longer the same until I reached large amounts like $250 dollars, which for me was a large amount at that time, at school during recess, I liked to see what to bet on, and that no matter what bet I won and it was like that for a while until one day I remember losing and putting all my money in a game, that's right all my money I had nothing else in case I lost or to buy lunch, go out to party or something similar for those who were They ask, I won, and I kept betting until I won $4000 dollars, which I lost in 1 night, yes, one night, it could be a lot or a little, but for me it was an amount that very few people win even a month, I continued and continued with relapses and increases . Everything was very strange and frustrating, he treated people badly, he was a son of a bitch to tell the truth, he lied, had a bad mood and other things, I even had an operation and I remember betting with fear that my family or friends would realize that I was betting. While I was on the stretcher, I lost more money, I never bet more than I had, I know it's not something to brag about but I think it's an advantage, anyway I continued betting intermittently for 1 year with ups and downs, self-exclusions on occasions and so on. , I remember that every time I went out to party I thought, let me bet so that the outing is free and like that, I work and it doesn't go well or badly for me but I am fortunate enough to not spend much, I don't earn much but I spend almost nothing, another climax point was when I recently met an incredible, attentive, beautiful girl, I am very lucky that she is my partner and I am proud of our relationship, I remember one time gambling and I don't know if out of mere revenge or frustration the intention was to cut it off and then regret it, I promised to quit and I left it for 30 days or something like that, time passed and I didn't do it very often but one day some friends and I went to a casino I started with $60 dollars and I ended up losing over $650, not only that but my peace had been ruined mental, I remember waking up in the night thinking about everything, and lastly yesterday as soon as they paid me I spent it and it should be noted that this is not the first time this has happened, but well I just wanted to vent, I will soon go to the psychologist, I am not broke nor have I I spent all my money but peace of mind is very valuable, I would like advice",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1eix6lg/day_2/,2,0,1722669048,

Day 234: Fatherly advice from a 58yo to those younger: Fuck gambling! ,"I can't turn back the clock but you can perfect your future. There's no FOMO in gambling, just regret and shame.

Don't stare at scores on your phone while on a date. Listen and look into her eyes. She might be the the one if you don't ruin it. 

Don't think gambling is a side hustle to your shitty job. Just kick ass at your shitty job. You will get noticed, promoted, and find you are no longer in a shitty job. 

Realize that this is the most fantastic time in your life for amazing  connections, bonds and growth experiences. 

Unless you engage in a sad, isolationing activity such as gambling because you are afraid of rejection. You are awesome, don't deprive others of knowing that!

Relapse (broke even but very scared),"For the last 4 days, I have been gambling everyday. These money is a lot for me since I am only earning 400$-500$ a month. 1st day, lost 50$ and broke even. 2nd day, lost 100$ and broke even. 3rd day, 200$ and broke even. 4th day, started really good, up by 50$ then got confident and started to bet 20% of my bankroll. Hands trembling, heart racing, lips shaking, yet still playing.. Didn’t even last a minute then boom, 0$. Lost 400$ then I deposited another 400$. Got a little lucky and I was able to get my money back. Overall, lost 400$ and broke even. 

Doing this for 4 days, I smoked like 8 packs of cigarettes. That’s 32$. Still lost, overall, money-wise. I couldn’t focus in my work, lost so much sleep since I want to win something for all these stress and anxiety I have experienced. I guess, I’m not as the gambler as I used too since I was still able to broke even and not just lost it all. Man, I used to drink alcohol non stop for 2 years a year ago, and I just stop it like nothing. Didn’t even had any withdrawal. I have minimized my cigarettes as well. From a pack to 3-5 cigarettes. I was about to stop it entirely then i started gambling. All my vices came back except for alcohol. My wife and I moved to a new house so don’t really have friends in the new house. I’m a social drinker and seldom drinks alone so no problem with alcohol whatsoever.

Video games was my thing. I was able to save money while working and playing video games. I didnt even buy games. I just pirate it. I was into strategy games like CK3 , Civilization 6, EU4, grand-strategy games. It takes time to enjoy this game, you need some goals and the harder it is, the more fun it is once you accomplished it. If you fail, just do it again. It takes so much time but it’s fun and fulfilling. 

Now, can’t even spend a minute in these kind of games. It so boring for me now, i cant even fathom I spent countless hours playing this game before. All I can think is gambling. Win or lose or even.  It’s not even fun, i don’t feel that giggly feeling when you’re having fun. Tried other games but no dice, don’t feel like it. Im like a guy who doesn’t have a hobby now. Im bored all day and only feel a little better when I’m gambling. This vice is the worst. Drinking is fine once you’re sober. You don’t even want to drink after a massive hangover. Once you start coughing and feeling shit, you don’t even want to smoke cigarettes until you get a little better. Your body stops you from doing these vices. But gambling man, nothing stops you except your will. With so many advertisements, it gets harder too.  I really hope we can beat this addiction. This addiction is the worst. It’s like slavery for pete’s sake. Work our entire life just go give it to the owner of the casino. And once you’re hooked, you will be working for the casino owner’s new mansion and his kid’s vacation. With cigarettes, Atleast, it kills you slowly, you still get to enjoy life.

25 years old male ,"This is a longer post so I apologize in advance. I wanted to share my story. My gambling addiction began back in 2021. I played football in college (small college in MN) so no I wasn’t that good hahah! My life was revolved around sports and after I got done playing I fell into depression and started seeing a therapist. I was working through my identity crisis and beginning to heal those wounds but at the same time I found online gambling.


What started off as small bets and something I thought I could handle started to turn into bigger bets and I eventually won 15 thousand dollars. I was ecstatic, couldn’t believe it. But surely over time lost all of it. I was crushed. But it didn’t deter me from stopping. Over the years and would win big and eventually lose it all. But I never wanted to admit to myself it was a problem and that I could control it. That I WOULD cash out. And occasionally I did to put it right back in. 

Fast forward to 2023, I got married, and told myself that I was going to be done with gambling because I was started this new journey and didn’t want to be the reason we were financially unstable. But that didn’t stop it. I hid to from my wife for months and months. 

At this point I was down around 30k through my years of gambling but still didn’t think it was a problem. Beginning of this summer I hit a 30k hand on online Let it ride and I so happy. I could pull the money and be even finally and be done. But it wasn’t enough and I wanted more and more and I eventually lost it all. I don’t think I have ever been that depressed it my life but I couldn’t tell my wife why I was depressed because of the shame, guilt and embarrassment I felt. I began to recognize the pattern, I couldn’t stop myself from gambling no matter how much money I was up and down. 
 
Through June and beginning of July this summer I bled my investment accounts and savings accounts to 0 dollars. While still holding on to the secret about how much money I have lost from my wife and my therapist. There was this strange relief about finally draining all of my savings. I had nothing left. I don’t know why I felt this way but I did. 

Then one night I told my wife my story. I cried, she cried, it was a powerful moment. One of humility and shame for myself. The follow week I told my therapist about my story as well. I felt nervous and ashamed telling those people because I finally admitted to myself I was a compulsive gambling addict. What led me to tell those two I have no idea but I did. It didn’t feel great but I did it. 

Greed led me down the path of gambling. Wanted to find a shortcut, cheat my way to being wealthy and try and retire early. I prided myself on the money I saved at my age, it was my identity, having money. After losing 75k in total I realized I didn’t even know who I was. Someone who couldn’t save money after rooting my identity in how much money I saved. How much farther I was ahead of other people. And now nothing. 

My first GA meeting I will be attending is on Tuesday after my therapist encouraged me to go to one. Along with seeing my therapist every other week. I’m not sure what the journey will look like. I have always been someone who mapped out my future of how much money my wife and I will have by a certain age. Now I’m started this new journey with people on my side. Am I scared, hopeless and depressed? Yes very much. Will I try my best everyday? Yes, even if my best doesn’t look perfect. But slowly I will work hard to live a meaningful and purposeful life not rooting in quick dopamine, gambling and money. I hope you all can as well. 

Day 1✅

If you made it this far, thank you. Just wanted to share my story to the random internet people.

Gambling is ruining my mental health and making me neglect everything else in my life. ,"Hi Everyone, this past month should have been a great summer break for me, free from school, time to work and hang with friends. I usually don't gamble much but for some reason I tried putting in 25 bucks in a online crypto casino. This was the first time I had won big. I hit a massive win of 1500 bucks and pulled it all out. For some reason a few days later I was depositing again. This time luck was not on my side, I kept losing, and depositing trying to recoup losses. After 4 days only the third of July. I had gambled almost 95% of my paycheck and winnings away. I was in a state of ""fuck it, what does it matter now"". For some reason I was extremely lucky and managed to hit a 5500x win gaining 1700 bucks and another 700 bucks on roulette that day. I felt the rush and relief of being saved and seeing that money come in, I felt invincible and that I had it under control. Fast forward 3 weeks. All the winning is gone and I managed to stay at what I would have had before gambling at all. 

This has been the most stressful month I have ever had. A rollercoaster of emotions mainly filled with regret and guilt. 

I know it just isn't worth it to deposit again, but I can hear the little voice in the back of my head telling me to deposit again, ""you are due to hit it again"" even though I had already been EXTREMELY lucky to even hit that big win in the first place. I  know if I deposit I would ruin my future finances and most importantly my mental health so I try not to but I have failed these past few days to refrain myself and have given in to depositing another 300. 

The thing with gambling and trying to recoup a loss is that you neglect everything else. I had not gone to the gym now for 4 weeks and I still have dirty clothes that needs to be washed laying in my room for 5 days now. I feel disgusting and filled with guilt. Why am I doing this to myself? 

The worst thing that ever happened to me this past year was hitting that big win. The house truly always wins. 

Sorry for the long write, needed to vent.

problem gambler from philippines,"hi. I am 20 M, i’m from a pretty well-off family (upper-middle class) currently about to enter 3rd year college. Little backstory, I was a crypto trader turned sports bettor due to the bear market.
I started sportsbetting early in 2023 where I was only spending considerably less amounts like ₱1k-₱3k as a deposit in betting (equivalent to $17-$50). Long story short, I kept increasing my bets to the point that I can’t stop gambling that I proceeded to approach OLAs or Online Lending Apps… now this led me to a huge amount of debt. 

Going back with my background, I am from a well off family, earning a monthly allowance from my parents of 25k ($431), studying in a prominent university, BUT, and I do not underestimate this. I have a total debt of ₱80k ($1.3k) until April 2025. As of writing (August 2nd), I am at ₱17k for the month of August, and luckily, I do not have any classes for the rest of the month, just a few activities here and there with friends. My main problem is, I have a big payment due on September amounting to at least ₱17k. I have yet to receive my monthly allowance for September on the first week.

With all that, I was wondering what is the best resort for this issue. For short context, my father’s family has been very keen on gambling in the province. Telling my parents is not an option as it would bring utter shame to me and my family as my family is the only one within our family tree that hasn’t succumbed to the addiction of gambling. Little do they know that I have broken that cycle in regards to us..

Feeling bad reading all these stories and people being depressed - I've worked once for a casino website,"The industry is trying to exploit so many people, on the same time lots of people work for the industry, but deep inside I couldn't do it long term - I felt bad ... I mean on the one hand you got a group of people, they ""innovate"" - innovate what? a new site, supposed to be ""fun"" i.e. fleece people off their hard earned money.

But,

I can't change it ... I personally don't mind receiving promotions for gambling because my brain is filtering them, but I was in both sides of the equation, many years ago I remember how gambling made me depressed and I know I can't play fire with it, not back then and not now....

Back to the topic,

It's a sad thing to read all these stories, we, human beings, have created addictions and some industries maximizing profits off people's addictions, it's not only gambling, it's also p\*\*n, alcohol but gambling is among the top ones destroying people's lives.

I mean someone is working so hard for 1 full year, makes $50k - $60k, worked so hard, and in a matter of a week, even a few days, and even a few hours - he/she could deposit it all (and more) into a website, lose it all, and we as society go as if it's all well about it.

Don't get me wrong, I'm the last one to be even allowed to criticize the industry, I was part of it, but still, I have so many mixed feelings about it all.

Gambling Addiction Help by Mobile App,"Hi all, I'm a former short term sports betting player and a former long term sports betting platform developer.

I'm thinking of building a mobile app to help people cutting the gambling addiction.

I'm based in a poor country where you see gambling/sports betting ads and places to play everywhere and this is annoying me because these places are selling fake hopes to poor people and are ripping them off. I know that in the past I worked developing such a platform and I regret it, at least the startup building it has failed and no one got their money or time lost.

I wanted to see your interest in such an app, I know there are some already, but I think they can be improved and I'm also accepting useful features proposals to help in cutting the gambling addiction.

The app will have the following features:

* Psychoeducation
* Tracking
* Assessment
* Feedback
* Community
* SOS
* Motivational quotes
* Distraction

I tried unaliving myself.,"I’m still in pain, depressed. Been wanting to kill myself. I’ve have not been able to get a good  sleep for weeks now because of thoughts of killing my self. This morning I finally tried. Got a belt over my neck, jammed it by my door got a step stool, and just hung there for a minute. At first I was thinking this is finally over. But then I started thinking of my family the amount of burden I would put on them. I opened the door which unjammed my belt. I felt lightheaded and my throat still feels like it has been punched. I am alive. I have to overcome this, and be responsible for my fuckups. Gambling took everything away from me, I can’t let it take my life too. But I can’t stop thinking about killing myself from time to time. Thank you everyone for the support.

"Relapsed yesterday, thought I could play with small stakes","From Monday to Thursday I played small stakes Blackjack after being clean for one week. I played with only $30 and I ran it up to $350. I was feeling good because I was not playing all the time and it felt controlled. I even managed to make some purchases for some items to make sure that even if I lost all my profit, I would still have gotten something out of the ""session"". 

Of course I lost it all, tilted and deposited $600 like an idiot. Lost all of it. Had the same feelings of disappointment and tilt that ruined my nights sleep and made me feel anxious, all the feelings that I am tired of and that I do not want to be dictating my life day in and day out. I did have moments where I thought I would deposit $500 and just go big but I stopped myself. 

Back on the saddle, it takes me some time for the fog of tilt to clear but I need to remind myself of the journey and just because I failed yesterday doesn't mean I can't be successful today, and the day after, and the day after that. 

Let's stay strong everyone! We all can have slip ups along the way, one part of this sub that I do not like is the fatalism some people have. I don't want to screw up but if I do, I don't want to feel like I have totally lost control and can't do it, it's just each day I will have to fight the fight!",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ei2lsz/relapsed_yesterday_thought_i_could_play_with/,5,2,1722578184,

AUGUST 1 Reflection GA,"Self-pity is one of the most miserable and consuming defects I know. Because of its interminable demands for attention and sympathy, my self-pity cuts off my communication with others, especially communication with my Higher Power. When I look at it that way, I realize that self-pity limits my spiritual progress. It’s also a very real form of martyrdom, which is a luxury I simply can’t afford. The remedy, I’ve been taught, is to have a hard look at myself and a still harder one at the Gamblers Anonymous Program’s Twelve Steps to Recovery.

*Do I ask my Higher Power to relieve me of the bondage to self?*

# Today I Pray

May I know from observation that self-pitiers get almost no pity from anyone else. Nobody—not even God—can fill their outsized demands for sympathy. May I recognize my own unsavory feeling of self-pity when it creeps in to rob me of my serenity. May God keep me wary of its sneakiness.

I can’t go on like this. I must change.,"TW: gambling wins/losses

It started so innocently.

Last year, I had a great feeling about a sports game. I never bet on sports before, but a comment on Reddit gave me the courage to download a gambling app and throw a hundred bucks on it. It won.

Now, $20k in the hole, I’ve had enough. I’m in professional school and not making an income. But over the past year I scraped pennies from various sources and threw it all away. Same story as everyone else: high highs, lower lows. The highest I got was $8k in the positive. I swore to myself that if I hit $10k, I was withdrawing everything and I was done. But you all know how that goes.

I always justified it by feeling that this money is all fake; one day when I have a high income, it’ll all be fine. But this shit distracts me from school constantly. I am an impulsive gambler. Hitting a quick win is so much more gratifying than studying, and my ADHD feeds off this. Betting used to be fun and thrilling. Now it’s simply anxiety-inducing.

I will have a high paying career after school, and I am terrified that this vice will cause me to ruin my financial future. If I can blow $20k while I’m still in school, unemployed, and saddled with educational debt, I can’t even imagine what I will be capable of with big paychecks.

I can’t tell my partner or family out of sheer guilt. But I have enough support to cover my daily living. I do have ~$18k in an investment account from previous work, my last source of funds, that I have not touched. Somehow this is the only discipline I’ve had, and I have essentially locked myself from withdrawing this money.

I just need somebody to tell me that I will be okay. That there is a good life waiting for me. Please. Thank you so much for reading.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ehnm5m/i_cant_go_on_like_this_i_must_change/,10,8,1722536030,

I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

I am grateful for the opportunity today to meet a new work colleague I’ll be working closely with in the future. 

I am grateful that I saw through this mornings meditation that my mind’s addiction to judgment is still very strong. 

I am grateful I have the opportunity right now to accept where my mind is and it’s thinking, what experiences life is presenting to me, relax, learn, and let it all go.

I am grateful for today’s Ga reflection and the reminder that self-pity is just a narrative my mind and heart made up, it isn’t real.

Day 38,"Last couple days, not sure why, but I’ve been getting a crazy craving to gamble. If I’m looking at it honestly I think it’s because I don’t make as much money as I’d like. I have a house but if it wasn’t for my wife paying the down deposit and her making good money there is no way we’d have our own house. Something inherent about being the man and wanting to provide for your family. I know times have changed but it’s still there. My job is decent but I really do wish that the wealth disparity in the world wasn’t as apparent. Maybe too deep of a conversation for this thread lol but that’s how I feel. I work OT every pay period, have a decent job with the municipality that I live in and still seem to live pay cheque to pay cheque. 

This was one of the main reasons I started to gamble. I’m sure there are other underlying reasons but that was a big one for me, just feeling poor.

I grew up in a single mother home in a basement apartment and always felt like the poor kid growing up. Money can’t buy happiness but it can buy you money related anxiety relief. And that anxiety has seemed to be there my entire life.

Ironically I just made it way worse by trying to gamble my way out of it.

JULY 31 Reflection GA,"One of the most serious consequences of the me-me-me syndrome is that we lose touch with practically everyone around us—not to mention reality itself. The essence of self-pity is total self-absorption, and it feeds on itself. Rather than ignore such an emotional state—or deny that we’re in it—we need to pull out of our self-absorption, stand back, and take a good honest look at ourselves. Once we recognize self-pity for what it is, we can begin to do something about it. *Am I living in the problem rather than the answer?* **Today I Pray** I pray that my preoccupation with self, which is wound up tight as a Maypole, may unwind itself and let its streamers fly again for others to catch and hold. May the thin, familiar wail of me-me-me become a chorus of us-us-us, as we in the Fellowship pick apart our self-fullness and look at it together. **Today I Will Remember** Change me-me-me to us-us-us.

Now she is asleep and im here contemplating if I can risk it for her. I dont know, my mind is not working right now, my degenerate mind is telling me to bet the same amount to get even.

Help me, what should I do, its like my body is moving on its own sometimes. I dont want to get on that situation again",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1egoktb/fate_is_testing_me/,13,17,1722436090,
When every sincere attempt to stop fails...,"There have recently been many posts about relapses. Reading about the frustration, discouragement, and anger that come with these relapses, I couldn't help but think about my own experience. Although I relapsed only two times, my initial efforts to stop were all unsuccessful because I was on that journey alone. It was only when I embarrassingly, humbly admitted to my wife and siblings that I have a gambling addiction and asked them to help me that I started to see progress and feel inspired to commit to making drastic changes in my life.

As a person of faith, I also found inspiration in my renewed relationship with Christ. On that day I consciously decided to stop, I opened my Bible where I landed on the story of Bartimaeus. Jesus asks Bartimaeus, ""What do you want me to do for you?"" Bartimaeus responds by giving him what matters to him the most – his eyesight, to be able to see. So, there I was, asking the same thing, one that I desire the most, ""Lord, help me to stop gambling!""

Are you frustrated and angry that you keep relapsing?

Day 1,"I’m officially done gambling, it has significantly ruined my life for the past 6 years. I have lost an estimated 60-70k within these past 5 years.  I’ve just lost another 7k this weekend and this is my breaking point where I can’t do it anymore. I’m done for good. I’m tired of working everyday slaving away just to blow within hours and give it to stupid filthy rich evil pricks who are own their yachts right now. I’m done paying their yachts gas money, while I work and sweat my balls everyday. I’m 24 years old and still have a decent amount of savings for my age.

 I’ve only realized that I seriously need to quit after  winning 50k and losing it all plus an extra 15k of my own money. This is a sick addiction. I can’t keep losing my hard earned money right down the drain

I hope to stay strong and not be able to waste another dollar. The bright side for me is that I can make every dollar lost within 1.5 years at work. It sure is a long time but I will do it and get everything back and more. Fuck this addiction and how shit it is. We always lose and never win, it’s never enough for us.

"Day 450: 1,350 hours regained","Gambling isn’t just about the money you lose. One of the most insidious costs is the time it steals from you. Each minute spent obsessing over bets, watching games with a single-minded focus on the outcome, and chasing losses is a minute that could have been spent on something far more meaningful. Time, unlike money, is a resource we can never get back. Every hour lost to gambling is an hour taken from our relationships, hobbies, personal growth, and overall well-being.

# Breaking Down 1,350 Hours

To put 1,350 hours into perspective:

* **56 Days**: This is nearly two full months of uninterrupted time.
* **Work Weeks**: If you consider a standard 40-hour workweek, it's over 33 weeks of work.
* **Leisure Activities**: It’s the equivalent of watching 675 two-hour movies or reading countless books.

105 Days on the Straight & Narrow,"Every gambler has their own story of how much gambling has cost them. The easiest way to quantify the loss is usually in dollars and cents: in my case I'm sure that I've lost well over $100,000 over about 5 years of gambling. But the lost money doesn't really bother me as much as the lost opportunity.

I've had 3 major gambling crises, each of which has resulted in hitting rock bottom, swearing off gambling and making a sincere effort to be better. After 2 of them I relapsed. After the 3rd, well it remains to be seen. 105 days and I feel incredibly cautious but also hopeful - we have to be hopeful.

  
What I want to say is that each of these crises has resulted in a lot of missed opportunity in life. I feel like each time I've hit rock bottom, I feel like I have to ""make it up"" by being extra committed to work and feel unable to have fun or enjoy myself. In short, the road back to normalcy involves a phase of depression.

  
For the first time in my life I had some freedom and flexibility to work less hours, visit friends and family, travel a little. I had the chance to do all the really fulfilling things in life. This most recent crisis forced me to go back to a job that I don't like and grind away. 

I've taken a lot of steps to prevent myself from relapsing again. I hope I never have to go through another gambling crisis ever again. I want to enjoy my life and gambling has been the single biggest obstacle to that, with no close second. 

  
I know that to avoid relapse I need to change my relationship with money and be happy with what I have. Even the richest person doesn't have enough money. Beyond providing for oneself and his family, money is a distraction or even a burden. So this time, when I feel financially comfortable enough to leave this job again, I won't be envious or greedy. I won't gamble. I'll just be thankful that I can enjoy my life and spend time with the people I care about.

  
Love you all. To anyone struggling fresh off a big loss, it gets better. I feel your pain. I know your pain. Have hope and we can have a brighter day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1eg8wvt/105_days_on_the_straight_narrow/,15,5,1722384145,

Then that one bad beat would come, and the evil ""gunslinger"" side of me would come out that was going to ""show them who's boss.""

Help a scared teenager out please...,"I am 17 years old, and I have had an online gambling addiction since I was 14.

Here is some context of my life:

I am in a debt of 55k (not from gambling, please don't question further, personal stuff), that I will eventually have to pay back when I get older. My parents have made it clear they are not willing to financially support me after I graduate from high school.

I worked as a freelancer developer when I was 13-16 and managed to make \~7 thousand dollars (I am mostly unable to do this anymore due to other reasons). I lost \~6k. Today, I managed to make that 1k I had left to 50 thousand dollars. Then, I lost 44k. I am now at 6k.

While I still lost a thousand dollars, I want to stop it there. But at the same time, it hurts having seen the 50k. It hurts still being down a thousand dollars.  
It also doesn't help that I will be going off to college soon, and have big dreams that may be possible (going to top tier school, but idk). College is, as many of you know, expensive, and I'm pretty sure 6k is pocket change, especially compared to what everyone else has (albeit most people don't have gambling addictions) going into college, and in the context of life 6k is nothing I think (I don't really know the value of money yet).

I could've paid off the debt with the 50k, or paid for college. I want that 50k. I need the 50k.

Someone please convince me to stop. Is 6k a lot of money? Please put it into perspective. I'm scared.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1eg1hc6/help_a_scared_teenager_out_please/,0,15,1722365823,

"Day 2, feeling mild temptation.",I opened up to my parents yesterday and they agreed to pay my house payment this month if I turn over my finances. Sounded like a good deal to me since I genuinely want help. I know everyone on here says that bailouts are bad but I have 2 children and absolutely cannot lose my house. However I already started to think of ways to sneak small amounts of gambling in. 2 of my online casinos offered me deposit bonuses today (probably since I haven’t deposited in 2 days) so I considered depositing my extra cash (only about 100 dollars) onto my chime debit card account so I could use them. Felt harmless to me since chime is seperate from my main account and I couldn’t cause any serious damage this way. Sounded like an easy way to double that 100 dollars. But then I realized this is just my illl brain trying to make excuses for myself to gamble and I need to overcome this urge. Even small amounts lead to a brain that wants to keep going with no end. I’m only on day 2 and I will overcome these thoughts.

Losing a relationship to gambling ,"Many of you might resonate with my story or others hopefully may see it is a sign to stop.

I am a 26 year old from England. Struggled with gambling for many years now. Things started to get really bad during Covid and I have been working from home since Covid which has definitely been a huge negative for me in trying to recover from this. Recently had my 3rd relapse and got myself in to significant debt again.

It’s now been 28 days since I last gambled. However the last 28 days have been some of the worst I have experienced, far more painful than losing money.

My girlfriend knew something was up for the last couple of months when I had gone back to gambling. I lied to her out of selfishness and probably having the gamble gambling mindset that I can fix this. Of course that never works, the lying has been the final straw for my girlfriend of 7 years she has now ended things for good. I really can’t blame her and honestly don’t want her to have to deal with this for any longer.

It’s quite amazing how gambling can ruin your life so quickly. Things really should have been so different.

I am now determined to never be that person I was 28 days ago. We all have to work on ourselves to beat this. Anyway, for me personally I am changing jobs in 3 weeks to an office based role, I am exercising every day and going back to therapy. 

I hope anyone else reading this, especially if you have been given another chance by a partner can quit for good before it’s too late. Gambling will never be worth losing the people you love.

Day 4 - What I'm personally doing to prevent relapses going forward.,"Hey, this is my **Day 4** after relapsing. This is my second relapse in over 5 years. First stretch I was clean for over 3 years, and second stretch was over 18 months before I relapsed again. What triggered it was possibly the huge fight with my SO followed by having a week off of work with no plans. Relapsing sucks and I wouldn't wish it upon anyone as relapses are often uncontrollable, but it does get better. I've been here before, and I can do it again. If I can - **YOU CAN.**

What I have started doing since I relapsed: 

* Started a budget planner. I started it to keep myself accountable over my finances. I have a credit card debt to pay, and I'm slightly overdrawn on my main bank account. I have 2 loans to manage too while needing money for things such as rent, food etc. 

* Started a personal blog-style diary. At the end of every day (or start of the new day), I write down how I felt/feel throughout the day with key points of the events that happened during the day. I'm doing it with an intention to look back at it if there's ever an urge, and see how I felt after a relapse. I think it'll help me keep myself from relapsing if it ever comes to it. 

This disease is awful, but it's manageable, and we can all do it - we just have to put all the will power and effort into work. My turning point was my SO nearly walking out the door as I couldn't talk to her after relapsing. It's fuelling me and giving me motivation to kick this addiction once and for all. 

**I CAN DO IT, YOU CAN DO IT, WE CAN DO IT, ONE DAY AT A TIME.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1efs0f7/day_4_what_im_personally_doing_to_prevent/,7,2,1722342326,
I need help. I'm addicted and it's getting worse. ,"Throw away account. I want to start this off by saying that I know how lucky I am. I go to a great school, my family supports me, I don't have debt or a family to feed. So, I'm okay. I know that. I'm grateful for that. But I am worried this is only going to get worse and I clearly can't control myself. 

  
For context, I've been very fortunate to be a winning sports bettor. That is not the problem. All-in-all, I'm up about 50k for the year I've been doing this. It's unpredictable. I could find an edge tomorrow or never again - I know that, which is why I want to save what I make and not piss it away. I've been limited on several accounts but just get accounts from friends and that's been fine. 

  
I've always had some problems with losing more than I wanted - mostly online. In person, friends or the act of having to go to an ATM gives me that extra second to stop myself. But online, money is just a click away. 

  
Here's the tragedy: Recently, I had a great week with sports betting. I had 20k just sitting in my account. I got some unfortunate news related to a job I wanted, so decided to play some slots for fun on the app where I was doing my sports gambling. I figured I could lose $500 and be okay with it if it made me feel better. But guess what? I won! I got super lucky and made about 5k. I felt good - not great (that's the most sinister part about this all - winning only feels good, but losing feels like a knife to the gut). Somehow, I convinced myself that this slot machine was broken, since I continued on with about 100 more spins and stayed up roughly 5k. I convinced myself that if I could be a winning sports bettor, why not a winning slots bettor? 

  
I kept going. I lost the 5k I made and another 5k. Who cares? Variance, I said to myself. It happens in poker and sports betting. Makes sense the same would happen here. I lost another 5k proving my 'theory'.  By this point, I knew the slot machine was not broken. I knew the writing was on the walls I was slipping into something dangerous. I considered trying to get money out of my bank account - like sending it to a friend or family member for a few days. But I did not. 

  
A few days later, I thought I should try to make some back. I won 5k once - even if it wasn't a positive EV play, maybe I could make some money back, right? Nope. I just kept losing. What happens next is sort of a blur - it's like I blacked out. But it was basically a freefall to the bottom. 

  
I lost the 25k I made on the sports betting in the past week. I felt horrible. I spoke to family. I said I was done. I said I learned my lesson and am glad it happened now and not later in life. Then my birthday came, and I was given some money in gifts. Again - I don't know what happened - I begged myself not to, I tried to talk myself out of it, but sure enough, all gone on the slot machine. 

  
At writing, I'm lucky to only have gambled money I can 'afford' to lose. But I can tell this habit is getting out of control and I am worried that I will soon cross the threshold of gambling what I cannot afford to lose. I don't want to exclude myself from the sites, because I'm making money on the sports betting. But I know that this needs to stop ASAP and that I clearly don't have a good plan to stop myself. My goal is to stop all online gambling that is not sports betting or poker - no online blackjack, slots, roulette, etc. The problem is it's all linked together. 

  
**I have two asks for the community:** 

**1. What can I tell myself to address the mental part of this? To stop the itch? To 'fix' the addiction?**

**2. What physical steps can I take to implement barriers to this happening again? Is there a way to block these sites from accessing my bank account via instant transfer? (If it took 3 business days, it would prevent the impulsivity that seemed to cause all this.)** 

  
Any ideas, help, or resources would be very helpful. I've read some stuff online, but most resources seem to say 'just stop' or point you to other resources that say 'just stop'. 



This is a serious problem, and one I thought I was above. I know gambling on slots/table games it is only possible to lose in the long run. Yet, I can't help myself. 



*A note for policy makers or people who care about changing the world: If this somehow gets scraped by some language algorithm and makes its way into anyone with any decision making power or a desire to do good in the world, let me tell you where I'd start for protecting youth. I see this problem everywhere within my college and even with younger youth. Corporations have started us on the gambling path early. People think it starts with sports betting access, but for me it started earlier. Plus, with sports, it's hard to lose a lot quickly. For me, it started with a video game called CSGO. They had literal gambling sites for 'skins' (which held significant real life value) that I was using in middle school. That's where it all started. Even games like Madden with packs you can 'buy' scratch a similar itch.* ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1efufk1/i_need_help_im_addicted_and_its_getting_worse/,4,2,1722348858,

Every possible to only quit certain types of gambling? ,"Hi everyone.   Hoping for some advice 

I''m a binge gambler - I can go days/weeks/months without gambling... But when I do, I tend to lose far more than I'm 'prepared' to.   I can technically afford some decent losses, and over the long run I've not lost too much - but I would've been in a much better spot if the money was just in my bank account rather than the ups and downs.  I can walk away with a big win, I don't always give it all back instantly, but over the long run, I will/do. 

Today is a major 'down', for me - online roulette is my poison. Started out with a bit of 'fun' play, lost a bit... Was ok with that.  About an hour later I hopped back on chasing losses, rinse & repeat for longer than I care to admit.  

I know I need to quit roulette specifically - not really a fan of any other games.  However, curious whether it's possible to quit 'just' that?  I like a flutter on the football/soccer on a Saturday, I like to buy lottery tickets, I'll buy a raffle ticket or 50/50 etc. . None of those *feel* remotely out of hand... But I suspect avoiding any sort of gambling would be my better bet? 

Would appreciate any advice etc. 

Cheers ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1efk819/every_possible_to_only_quit_certain_types_of/,1,4,1722312923,
Please help me see the bright side.,"Lost 3k the other day. Self excluded and have no plan to return. But I’m still having a hard time understanding how I blew that much in a single day. 

I started gambling 6 months ago. It was a roller coaster. Long story short was up 6.5k at my peak. Walked away after losing 3k and up 3.5k over the time I started gambling. 

I’ve mainly stopped for religious purposes as I know nothing good comes from gambling in the long run. Am I lucky to walk away without actually losing money? It just still is shocking how I did that in one day, I can’t believe it. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1efjucn/please_help_me_see_the_bright_side/,7,17,1722311697,
Day 449- Hope for better days have arrived ,"If you’re struggling with a gambling addiction, there’s hope for better days. Recovery is possible. I, myself have nearly 449 days under my belt and I can tell you each day away from gambling is a win, hence the name: Winning Daily. 

1) self exclude- ban yourself from in person casinos, easy access apps and anything you use to gamble. If/when you decide to self exclude, consider lifetime ban. If not, when the exclusion is lifted, you’re right back to gambling again and end up in a similar situation as you’re in currently. 

2) give up access to money or bank account: for some of us, seeing too much month at the end of our money could be a trigger to gamble and think we double the money in our bank account. I’m here to tell you, that’ll never happen. You deposit that money, or get loans and use credit to gamble, next thing you know, you lose it all mindlessly gambling. So if that’s a trigger, let someone you know such as a family member or very close friend keep watch of your bank account and help keep you accountable. 

3) Get a community of people behind you. Preferably other human beings who know that same struggle you’re going through. 

I created a discord server for all those struggling with gambling addiction and are looking to make a change in their life. Within the virtual halls of this Discord server, members find a sense of camaraderie and understanding that is often lacking in their day-to-day lives. Here, individuals from all walks of life come together to share their experiences, offer advice, and lend a listening ear to those in need.

One of the most powerful aspects of the ""Compulsive Gamblers in Recovery"" Discord server is its emphasis on empathy and non-judgment. Regardless of how dire our situations may seem, members are met with compassion and encouragement rather than condemnation. This culture of acceptance fosters a sense of belonging and empowerment, empowering individuals to confront their addiction head-on. If this seems interesting to you, or you know someone who has a gambling addiction and are looking for help, here’s the link: https://discord.gg/d5NgC4nZ

4) with most addictions, there’s an underlying issue that needs to be addressed. This isn’t just gambling addiction but with most. The best way to address those issues is with professional help with a therapist. Consider seeking out professional help to conquer your addictions

Stay grinding, stop gambling. Life gets better. One day at a time.

Unable to hide tax payment notices - Parents will know my gambling,"I am working part time jobs at various places, and my parents don't know about this.

They don't know that I lost thousands of dollars from gambling with stocks.

I can make up for the lost money by doing part time jobs, but the problem is that my income from part time jobs are all registered through the tax office by the employers, which means the government has all the records of my income.

Since I am registered in the same household as my parents, the national healthcare is under my mother's name, who is the owner of our house. 

If I work over 8 days a month, which I have to, my parents will automatically get notified that my healthcare payment status has been changed from household member status to worker status.

Then they will know that I have been doing part time jobs.

And the mailbox would be filled with other tax related notices, especially national pension related ones.

I had no reported income since living expenses are sent by my parents, but the income from part time job would make me have to pay taxes monthly, which would be a real hassle.

Since my income would be for making up the lost balances, and not for making additional savings, I would eventually have to explain what happened.

I am lost here, because my purpose of doing part time jobs was because I never wanted to let my parents know, but they will know everything pretty soon.

"3.5 months clean, never thought I'd get here.","I made a post a couple months ago about not gambling on payday [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1d19j83/i_didnt_gamble_this_payday/).

Payday, like many of you, was always fucking awful for me. In the UK we can claim incoming bank transfers at 4pm the day before they're due to arrive (with certain banks), so typically by the day ticked over to my *actual* payday I'd already be flat broke.

I'm really not sure what changed mentally but I just couldn't be arsed with it anymore. The anxious waiting for money to hit my account, the time between withdrawing crypto and the transaction getting confirmed, losing the money faster than I can actually deposit it. The 31 days of sheer pain and misery afterwards.

It's just so fucking pointless, it leads to nothing. I just gave up *trying*, I think maybe trying to chase losses but the high was the main attraction for me.

My mental state is immensely better. I sleep through every single night. I can go into a shop and buy something if I want it.

I cannot stress that point enough. I see something I like. I fucking buy it for myself. That money isn't earmarked for gambling anymore, it's got value. Crazy.

I haven't had a tattoo in nearly 3 years because they're expensive (£200 is too much for a tattoo but £3k into slots is fine!) but [I finally got something done, without worrying about the money](https://i.redd.it/rhb58hjd34fd1.jpeg). It's stupid as fuck but I love it.

"“ I’m an addict, I wanna stop but I keep relapsing… “ — Update Thread","Originial Thread (25/07/2024) ⤴️

————————————————————

•Update #1 (29/07/2024):

I’ve decided to start this thread to record my recovery journey as a gambling addict and I will update it every week or so. 

I ended up getting my money wired about 2 days later. I also ended up losing about $100 on UFC 304 last weekend (ironically I had all the right winners, just didn’t anticipate two quick finishes inside the 1st round from Tom Aspinall and Paddy Pimblett) and finally self-excluded from Bet365. I’m now officially banned/self-excluded from every single major sportsbook / online casino worth a damn in Canada. In 5 years from now I’ll regain access to FanDuel and I’ve self-excluded from Bet365 for 1 year. This should give me ample time to get my shit together and mature enough stop idealizing gambling as a means to make money. Here’s to Day #1 🥂

In regards to my addiction to nicotine, I’ve decided to cold turkey it. I’m currently on Day #2 and the withdrawals symptoms are definitely making me cranky and my brain foggy, but given that it only takes 72-96 hours for your brain to kick an addiction, I’m too far into it to give up now. I went back to my MMA gym yesterday for a training session and it was exhausting, but seeing everyone again and doing the sport I’ve always loved, it gave me the motivation I need to get back into great shape. As far as my skills go, I still haven’t lost my touch despite my hiatus and abusing my own health, which is really encouraging! 

I really allowed myself to be influenced by people in my life into thinking that I had to choose between making money working a job or pursue my fucking dream. 
Well since then all I’ve done is waste a year of my life. 

I’ve tried working a normal job, adapting to the conforms of society and tame myself enough to deal with all the snowflake bullshit that comes with it. But honestly, FUCK THIS! It’s killing me slowly and I can’t take it anymore!

I’ve dreamt of winning a UFC title for the last 11 years and I’m tired of trying to live a life that isn't for me. I'm a fighter down at my core, always have been and no amount of snowflake propaganda and whatever the fuck else will ever change that. I at least gotta try!

Trying to Stop before I blow this! ,"Hello Everyone!
Trigger warning: I was one of the few people to get lucky with a big win. Please don’t read if you think that reading about a big win may trigger a bad decision! 

I am new around here, so I thought I’d share my story. Reading posts and comments on here have already been so encouraging! 

I’m also new to feeling like I have an addiction with gambling. It wasn’t until a few months ago that it’s become a real problem that I’m finally able to admit I have. Before this, I was maybe a once or twice a year gambler. I considered it something I only did to splurge on vacation if we were going on a a cruise or the hotel had a casino. I was fully capable of bringing $500-$1000 and sticking to that budget during the vacation, win or lose. I was the type of person that if I got lucky and doubled that budget, I’d walk away happy and not gamble anymore. If I lost, also okay. It was a planned vacation splurge. 

Then, one night out of boredom, I downloaded an online casino app. Everything changed.  I piddled back and fourth for about a month on it. I was anywhere from $2,000 down to $3,000 up for those first few weeks. Back and fourth, back and fourth. But it was surely luring me in... but then one night as I was playing, I hit a HUGE jackpot. Almost 600k! I absolutely couldn’t believe it. I was shaking! I never in a million years thought I’d ever see so much money in my lifetime! Life changing! 

However, even with this amazing win was it enough? As I’ve learned reading through here, it’s NEVER going to be enough. I continued playing of course. I lost somewhere around 10k of my big win.  But then the unthinkable happened. I won big again! This time 35k. I absolutely couldn’t believe it! Two huge wins within a month? Surely I was some sort of gambling master or just had luck on my side, right? Wrong! 

As it stands, I’ve currently lost around 50k of those initial 2 big wins. 2 years ago if you ever told me I’d blow through  50k in about 3 months gambling,  I’d of told you that you were insane. Who was I becoming? 

 I know if I don’t get help NOW, I will sit and spin through every last cent and eventually be down.  I still have the majority of my wins and I want to protect them from myself and my new addiction. But the brain is so stupid when it’s addicted! Why can’t I be happy I’m still up hundreds of thousands of dollars that MOST people will never come close to? Why do I still feel like I need to make up the 50k of the wins I’ve since lost? Am I really going to F this up? 

“Just one more big win is all you need!” stupid brain says!

Holding on strong so far. I’m one week in of no bets and ignoring the intrusive thoughts. I’ve moved some money into places I can’t access it with one click during a weak moment. I’ve locked myself out of the app. I’m fortunate that at this time I still have no desire to go to a real casino (although now I’m more cautious of that too as I see I have the addiction within me)

Day 9 relapse,"Much like my day 3 relapse, I knew exactly what was going to trigger me today. I got paid today. I had overcome the trigger on my Day 3 relapse, which was putting money onto a specific account that I need to use but is also connected to easy casino deposits. I had gotten a transfer yesterday and resisted all day. I was really proud of myself. But today I had a lot of frustrating things occur, mainly not getting the item that I had purchased. This is a classic trigger for me, spending money on a non-essential item and gambling to get it for 'free'. So a combination of two things and I cracked, downloaded the app and put $100 on. Luckily I won like $90 and stopped before tilting. I cashed out and deleted the app. 

  
I have a lot of stuff going on right now that is leading me to think I should gamble to reduce stress or to zone out. But I don't want to be a slave to gambling, I know long term I will lose, and I want to enjoy having my mind on other things as I have this past week or so. I fought, and lost, to my trigger demons but it makes me stronger to face them again. This week will be a true test; I have money in my account (already owe $1300 of it) and need to keep it that way. I will spend money this week on stuff that I don't mind spending money on and can't think about winning it back. 

This is a journey and I am winning, regardless of a few slip ups. I need to face them and not use it as an excuse that I relapsed and am back to square one so I might as well tilt off some money. I am stronger than that AND I really do want to quit. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ef2wyl/day_9_relapse/,3,1,1722268106,
"Day 3 - No urges, but not feeling well mentally either.","""Be content with what you have, not with what you don't."" is the quote I live my day to day now. While I may not have as much money, and while I'm still in debt - it'll all be okay. It's all manageable over time. I still have so many things I can be grateful for - my absolutely amazing fiancé, our dog, my family, roof over the head and food on the table, a job to earn the money and all the other beautiful things that life has to offer.

I've started a budget planner that I made in excel the other day, and also started writing a diary for my own sanity. The purpose of the diary is to reflect on my day, let the frustrations out, let the emotions flow, and keep myself accountable to never end up in the same position. This is my 3rd relapse in 5 years, and I hate the feeling all the same as it always involves losing 4 figures while still being in debt. It sucks, but this is the very last time I relapse. If I ever relapse again, I'll just end it.

Avoiding gambling apps on IOS ,"Hi everyone,
I hope this post is allowed. I myself do not have a gambling addiction but my fiancé has recently come out a few month ago sharing he struggles with one. I have been trying my best to be supportive when we try to come up with ways to lessen the temptation but it defiantly seems hard to avoid. We live in Ontario and unfortunately there is no self exclusion to ban you from all apps without going on each one and doing it. We recently found a little bit of a work around if you are an Apple user and have someone who can support you/who your trust who also is an apple user. 

Apple has a feature called family sharing which allows parents to keep an eye on their kids up until the age of 18 including limiting the apps they have access too. What we found out you could do to make this feature work for adults is have the person change their birthday by going to settings-click profile at the top of the screen-personal information-and change birth year to be the year that would make the person between age 14-18 (feature won’t work well if they age is under 13 and stops working after they age turns 18). From there have the person you trust with also has an apple device to enable family sharing on their device and have them send you an invitation. Once you accept the request you will be added as a “child” under their family. This person can control your screen time etc but we have all that turned off except for the app restrictions. Have the person you trust click on your name in the family sharing section and go to screen time-content and privacy restrictions-store,web,Siri & Game Center content-apps-select 12+. In Canada I have found all gamblings apps are rated 17+ so with the apps restricted to 12+ no gamblings apps will be able to be downloaded and the App Store will give a message that it isn’t available to be downloaded. Remember to have the person turn on that you can still listen to explicit music etc. this feature makes it so you are not able to change the app restriction yourself as the person in charge of your family account has it password protected. It also makes it so that you can’t remove yourself from the family unless the moderator removes you themselves (which can be done by them at any time). There is also an option to block websites so if there is a site you visit often, under the same area to limit the apps you can have them go under web content and have them input these sites.

I know this is obviously a bit of an invasive work around and that there is obviously ways to access gambling not just through apps but I just thought I would share the way we have tired to lessen his temptation. It seems there are so many apps these days and with most of us using a smartphone it seems they are all too accessible. 

In the hopes this is able to help even just one person I just thought I would share!

I want to stop,"I’ve been an on again off again gambler for a few years now but it’s become something I do very regularly now (online). The other day I deposited $20 and lost it pretty quickly I then deposited another $20 and lost that too and before I knew it, I had deposited over $5000 which was everything in my bank account + savings and was supposed to last me until the end of next month and rent was due in 6 days. I managed to get it all back luckily but I couldn’t believe what it nearly cost me.


 Now this has happened before but the result hasn’t been so lucky and I’ve ended up losing everything in my bank account only to be left asking myself…. What just happened. It’s something I can never usually explain or understand while Its happening, how can I be such an idiot? But this time it was different, this time I knew what I was doing and I stopped and asked myself a few times… is this really something you want to do, what will happen if you lose, remember what happened last time? I answered those questions but I carried on depositing anyway, at one point I started retching thinking I was going to throw up and my whole body was shaking knowing how badly I had messed up, having to explain to my girlfriend why I couldn’t pay rent this month (which was due in 6 days) having to call my parents telling them why I needed to borrow money and it nearly broke me. 

I immediately withdrew my winnings and after I calmed myself down it fully dawned on me how close I was to losing everything and I went on to my banking app and I realised that all happened in the space of 32 minutes… 32 minutes it took for me to nearly lose everything.


Like I said before this has happened to me before but I was still living at home and always had that safety blanket but I think it terrified me so much knowing how I nearly lost everything in the space of 32 minutes. I also think the difference this time was knowing I had no one to bail me out, my parents don’t know how much I gamble, although they know I lost all my money at the casino once, my girlfriend has no idea how much I gamble and she wouldn’t be able to support us both or pay rent on her own for the next month and I couldn’t ask my friends to bail me out again.  

I have now set a $1 deposit limit on every site I can think off and have self excluded from the rest and I urge you all to do the same if you can. 

If you know or think you might have a problem please just don’t gamble, don’t deposit thinking oh it’s only $20 because for us the $20 is never just $20.

Relapsed again (i got bored at playing),"I promised myself not to gamble again and If i did it will be the lowest amount possible and no raising bet whatsoever! I did that and I was playing Hilo. After 15 minutes, I lost one dollar, after 30 minutes, I was up 2 dollars, after an hour. I broke even. I end up playing mobile legends on my phone cause it was so boring lol. Now that I know I wont get rich gambling, i didnt want to spend my time guessing if the next card is high or low. Fucking boring game, to be honest. Hahaha. I tried it with a real card and tried guessing if its high or low, i didnt even finish the deck hahah. I think once we get over the loss we have and know that we aint winning a lot of money, there is no point in gambling. Like, if you win 100$, is that a life changer? Of course not, thats just one weekend, or even a day. I still have the urge to gamble sometimes but thats my rule. If I want to gamble, just gamble the lowest possible, wanna be rich in gambling? Do that while betting 0.1$. (This doesnt apply in slots but if you still wanna do slots with this, im sure you get bored after an hour as long as you dont raise your bets) Imagine getting a 100x to a 0.1 bet (Congrats, you won a dollar, and thats very rare) If you can do that while not raising your bet then maybe you can be a professional gambler.  Now, im just planning to buy a ps5, its so much fun to play that rather than the boring gambling game. I also know that if I lose the same amount of money equivalent to the ps5, im going to hate myself. So i just rather buy a ps5 now in installment. No tv though, my wife broke it when we had a fight about my gambling.

Tomorrow is Day 1,"If I keep living like this, I will die. I am a 28 year old female who has been addicted to online gambling since January 2021, when it became legal in my state. Before then I was a girl who loved the little things in life. I bought my own car, own house and was good with my money. I had 6k in checking, slowly growing every month, 1k in savings. I know it doesn’t sound like much but was proud of that as a young single mom. I enjoyed summers, seasons changing, outings, holidays, tv shows, learning how to cook, decorating my house, spending quality time with my son, spending quality time with my boyfriend, going to the gym and the little things in life. I took care of myself, kept my hair and nails done, enjoyed shopping trips for new clothes, liked to look cute, do my hair and makeup.  

It all went downhill in January 2021 when I found out I could “earn” extra money online doing something fun. I would be on winning streaks. Watch my account jump up 1 grand in 2 days. It was absolutely thrilling and I thought I figured out a new life hack. I remember one day I hit 10k in a day. I was on top of the world. Completely locked in to this new lifestyle. I thought I’d be rich doing this.

Until it all fell down. I lost everything and more. Defaulted on all my credit cards, took out over 20k in loans that I have now defaulted on. Life lost all its color. I feel like I am in survival mode 24/7. I lost 20 pounds and don’t even recognize myself in the mirror anymore. I let my looks go and I don’t spend money on anything extra that’s not gambling.

I’ve tried quitting dozens of times. I make about 1k a week as a bartender and as soon as my bank account gets above 500, I see that as the green light to deposit 25 dollars and see if I can make it 1000. Sometimes it works, but I always lose control and my bank account ends up at 0. And then I feel ill and don’t even want to continue living. I don’t even enjoy quality time with others anymore. I’m a walking zombie who looks forward to nothing. It’s a cycle that’s been going on for years. All I think about is money 24/7. I have absolutely 0 interest in anything else.

I am posting this today because I want to reclaim my life. I want to be the girl who used to enjoy life, who enjoyed spending time with her loved ones. Who cared about her appearance. Who wanted to be better everyday. I’ve posted on here before, with fail. But this is the last time. I cannot do this anymore. I want to spend the last year of my 20s enjoying life again. I want my brain to go back to normal. I cannot count today as day one because I lost 100 dollars this morning, so tomorrow the clean slate starts. 

Today, July 28 I have 180 dollars to my name. Luckily I still have a house, car, my kids, my boyfriend, my job that I love and make good money doing, my health, and my life. I am going to give all I can to turn this around, otherwise it’s going to end in catastrophe.

I will be posting on here the days I’m not feeling strong, and giving an update after 30 days.

If anyone has tips on how to get through this after years of failure please let me know. I’ve tried self exclusion but I always find a way around it and it seems to make my impulsivity worse. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1eefvvb/tomorrow_is_day_1/,24,15,1722195900,

What has gambling done to you,"Hi everyone,

I’m 28 years old and a father to two boys. I started gambling in 2017, and things quickly spiraled out of control. By 2018, I gambled away my tuition fees and had to drop out of campus. I managed to enroll at another university, but continued gambling, even though my fees were paid directly by the institution. 

During this time, I also developed a dependency on weed, but that’s something I’ve been able to manage. I graduated in 2023, but throughout my studies and beyond, gambling remained a constant issue. I secured a job in November 2023, but have been gambling away my entire paycheck since then.

Right now, my main concern is making it to my next paycheck in 30 days. I’m not deeply in debt, just some family obligations and unpaid bills for house help. I’m here because I want to stop gambling, and my immediate challenge is finding a way to get through the next month without giving in.

A WARNING FOR LONG TERM RECOVERY ,"Hey Guys,

Been a while since I’ve been in here. It’s been 500 days since I last placed a bet. But I’m here to tell you, I still to this day face urges to gamble. Yes these urges haven’t been as persistent as they were in the beginning but lately it’s been hard. 

I had a $5 bonus bet granted to me a few days ago. The bookmakers have always been sending me offers over the last year and a half but I had resisted. I’m a little disappointed that I actually used this $5 bonus bet. I’m not counting it as a relapse as I haven’t used my own money but I’m coming here to speak out so I don’t. 

I think the reason I placed it was because I had returned from Europe and spent a lot of money. My stupid gambler logic is that I can recoup some spendings by gambling quick .

Thankfully no proper relapse yet and I’m determined to keep clean!

25 and lost everything + more,"Here is my sad sad story. 

I started online gambling In December of 2023, only small bets untill February 2024, I won 45k on stake.us and was so overcome with joy, i told my girlfriend we would get married, i was about to pay off my car, school loan, and i was so fucking excited about life! Once i cashed it out had about 47k in crypto. Then i discovered sports betting on Bovada. It was so easy to deposit, I kept doing it, loss after loss, I felt like Shohei Ohtanis interpretor. In 2 months I realized I lost already half of it. So what did i do? I kept riding thinking i would win it all back. Kept going for about a month and was sadly down to my last 7k. I put it all on a hand if baccarat and lost it all. Then I applied for a couple credit cards, cause my credit was great, and used up all my credit line. I’m now 46k in credit debt. I’ve hit rock bottom. Don’t chase your losses. If anyone has and advice for me to get financially back on track I would more than appreciate it. I know I’m not a lot alone in this, so I hope someone reads this and changes their mind about making that stupid bet.

Winning is losing. ,"Never thought I would’ve share my problem on reddit, but here I am. 

I’m a 19 year old male and i started gambling almost a year ago in school.

We weren’t allowed having phones during school time, even in lunch break. This “rule” was new so eventually we started playing with cards and after a few weeks someone had a bright idea to play blackjack with 50 cents. It got to a point where we had a “accountant” to keep up with the winnings and losings of everyone playing and the bet sizes kept rising.

This was all fun and games until i found the real deal and i started gambling on online casino’s. 

During this time i had and still have a part time job, where i typically make around 2k per month. The very first payment after finding out about online casinos went straight out the window. Lost my whole salary. I felt depressed and such a idiot losing all my money over some stupid game. But still there was a itch and i had to gamble again, so i did. Eventually I lost every  penny to my name. Around €2400,-  

Next month, salary comes in and this is where it all started to go up but mentally also down. 

I made €6500 playing roulette starting with €500, and the day after a thousand and the winning streak kept going and going until eventually having made around 13k in 5 days. During this time i still went to school and felt like an absolute baller. Bought a new car, new gaming pc, designer clothing and literally throwing 50 euro bills and hiding them for students to find. And this streak wasn’t done yet. 

I didn’t gamble for two weeks straight because i had spend all of my money and i enjoyed riding my car around town. But when the next salary came in i made 20k ish like it was nothing. This is when it all started to fall down. 

I was completely lost, being on cloud 9 and having no sense of reality. I still went to school but i missed half of my classes and only went to flex. My routine was shit, the food that I was eating was garbage to the point that i needed to go to the hospital because of all the junk. I lost my license because of speeding and the only thing in my mind was gambling and making money. Only waking up to wait for the clock to strike midnight thinking i would’ve have extra luck gambling. 

Everything in my life was falling apart. Health, vision on my future and most of all my brain. My brain got so fried to the point that I couldn’t function like i normally could. I couldn’t stand working all day long for 2k per month. There is nothing i could do that requires discipline, I was truly controlled.

This all happened BEFORE I lost all of my money and I did. I know owe 8000 to my parents, I have to sell my car because it keeps breaking down. I have no money in the bank nothing. Eventually luck runs out and when it does you get hit hard. Im trying to get over it but I still have a need to gamble. The feeling of playing and winning is a drug that I need. But I’m also aware that this may make me end my life. 

PLEASE learn from my mistake. Winning is losing trust me, you will go in a very dark path and I hate myself because of this. Even if you win a million. The money is cursed, you’re enjoying and using the money from people who lost it and probably needed it. You’re dancing with the devil. Karma is real and it will hit you unexpectedly.

630 days gratefully without a bet,"Today:  
·       I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

·       I am grateful for the session with my therapist yesterday and realizing the non-acceptance hamster wheel I’m keeping myself on.

·       I am grateful for his tough words – I am 100% throwing myself an inadequacy party. I compare myself to a made-up ideal, and when I perceive that I am falling short of that ideal, I tell myself that I’m not good enough. I go out of my way to find and mentally fixate on examples of how I’m not good enough to prove that this self-destructive inner theory of mine is correct. I ignore all the evidence that shows that I am a good person, with vulnerabilities and weaknesses, just like everyone else. This ideal person is just bullshit, its a lie.

·       I am grateful that I know now that I made this ideal person up because I’m afraid of what will happen if I’m just me, right now, imperfect and fully vulnerable to painful feelings. That’s a big reason why I cling so hard to the belief that the ideal is real, that I can become someone who is perfect and invulnerable to pain and will never be judged negatively by others. The reality that my ego doesn’t want to accept is that that person doesn’t exist and never has.

·       I am grateful for new faith that each day that I let go of that ideal version will lead to greater self acceptance and acceptance of life as it is, not how I want it to be.  

·       I am grateful that each I let go of that ideal person, I’ll grow and realize the wonderful person I already am inside, and learn how to live a serene, wholesome, and fulfilling life.

·       I am grateful for this journey.

·       I am grateful for all of you.

Cbf Rebuilding this time,"Just finished up a multi month swing day trading , made a years salary in a week and proceeded to go down and up and all the way back down again. All I had to do was lower the risks and I could of made a living off this , smaller but steady gains. With the amount of capital I had it was easy enough to make a regular salary out of but now I'm tapped out I have to go back to a unfulfilling job.

This time I don't want to rebuild, the usual spark after taking losses is gone. I feel maybe I need to become homeless for somtime so I can punish myself and realize the value of money again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1edgubs/cbf_rebuilding_this_time/,4,3,1722088258,
Afraid of casino now,"When you do read some story here, it make you realise how far someone could go into it

Sleeping in a car without warm system on a snowing night

Walking x miles to go home cause gas money was gamble away

Get kicked out by casino's pitboss

Sleeping in front of slot machine

It make me freeze just to read some stories here 🥶

Just not feeling myself. Keep distancing myself from people,Long story short I’m down 8k don’t want count in my winnings. But it’s gonna take me 5 months to get money back at a 9-5 just to sorta break even . I already quit gambling but still feeling down everyday. I can’t even talk to my co workers because I’m just so down and don’t feel energetic to talk. It’s hard to feel happy when you know you fucked up by losing so much money it’s so painful. I can’t even  talk to my family I just want isolate myself and be alone all the time. I’m trying so hard to see the positive but I feel like a heavy weight in my shoulders. Will I ever be able to go back to normal? Before I lost I was so happy and life was great and now everyday has been so tough now. Is this just the recovery withdrawal ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ed4fxy/just_not_feeling_myself_keep_distancing_myself/,4,3,1722043233,
