<h1>Reddit Research: /r/problemgambling community engagement project</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

Prior to Evive, options for online problem gambling (PG) communities were limited. However, a sizable community emerged within the Reddit platform as a resource for those in PG recovery.

<h2>Purpose</h2>

As it is fundamental to Evive to establish a strong recovery community, I wanted to analyze the usage of the subreddit /r/problemgambling. From this analysis, I expected to discover the motivations behind peopleâ€™s use of the community so that the Evive community can be catered to fulfill the needs of its members and to make its benefits clear and intuitive to those who are new. To that end, I want to answer the following questions:
* For what reasons do individuals post in the community?
* In what ways do people benefit from posting?
* What emotional payoff (e.g. introduction of a desired emotion, relief from an aversive emotion) do people expect and experience from posting that allows them to overcome the guilt, shame, and other aversive emotions that tend to keep them otherwise silent?
