<h1>Reddit Research: /r/problemgambling community engagement project</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

Prior to Evive, options for online problem gambling (PG) communities were limited. However, a sizable community emerged within the Reddit platform as a resource for those in PG recovery.

<h2>Purpose</h2>

As it is fundamental to Evive to establish a strong recovery community, I wanted to analyze the usage of the subreddit /r/problemgambling. From this analysis, I expected to discover the motivations behind people’s use of the community so that the Evive community can be catered to fulfill the needs of its members and to make its benefits clear and intuitive to those who are new. To that end, I want to answer the following questions:
* For what reasons do individuals post in the community?
* In what ways do people benefit from posting?
* What emotional payoff (e.g. introduction of a desired emotion, relief from an aversive emotion) do people expect and experience from posting that allows them to overcome the guilt, shame, and other aversive emotions that tend to keep them otherwise silent?

<h2>Method</h2>

On 17 July 2024 I selected the 100 most recent posts , sorted by new. Range was from the most recent posts up to 72 hours past. Each post was reviewed for narrative and emotional content until patterns became apparent.

<h3>Post Type</h3>

Among the post narratives, I decided to begin assigning “Post Types” according to the following list of types and definitions:

1. Affirmation: Post whereby the original poster (OP) provides statement affirming their desire to recover from gambling addiction or abstain from gambling behavior;
1. Confessional: OP provides a story wherein they divulge gambling or related behavior, usually including the financial, emotional, and relational consequences of their behavior;
1. Day Count: OP is using their post to count their days of abstinence. There may be additional text in the form of an “Affirmation” or “Progress Report”, but I am considering this category as primarily a means of accountability to self and/or others for abstinence;
1. Observation: OP provides information on changes they have observed in themselves or their living situation as a consequence of gambling abstinence or recovery. This is typified by insights resulting from the clarity offered by gambling abstinence or recovery;
1. Offering Recovery advice: OP offers help or advice to others who are struggling;
1. Progress Report: OP delivers news on their recovery, often identifying benefits of recovery, positive changes in relationships, and other recovery milestones;
1. Question: OP asks a question of the community that is related to problem gambling but is not a direct request for recovery advice;
1. Rant/Vent: OP expresses anger, frustration, disappointment, or other aversive emotions with the apparent goal of relieving the emotion(s) and/or gaining validation on their viewpoint from the community;
1. Seeking help and/or advice: OP is struggling with the consequences of their gambling behavior and is seeking relief and assistance from the community;
1. Story: OP provides a narrative of their experiences with gambling addiction and recovery specifically as a cautionary tale to motivate change to the benefit of others who are struggling.

<h2>Emotional Content</h2>
Acknowledging that determining the emotions experienced by a poster when submitting their post is at best a challenge, I decided to apply to each post up to three key emotions being expressed given the text and context of the post.

The goal of capturing emotional content was secondary but was included in hopes of providing additional insight and content represented by each post.

Roughly thirty unique emotions were identified. At this time, I will neither list nor define each of them except as requested or required to provide further context to any post’s type, the motivation behind the OP’s submission, or for other uses beyond the initial scope of this project.

For purposes of initial analysis, the emotions extracted serve to justify or validate the motivations for the post.

For example: [This](https://old.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1e3v496/my_gambling_story_dealing_with_a_heartbreak/) post was assigned Post Type “Story”, a type that can be considered inherently emotionally ambiguous. The post title, “My gambling story + dealing with a heartbreak…” might suggest that its content is negative or aversive in nature. However, a full reading of the post reveals a range of emotions, identified for the purposes of this project as “Regret”, “Relief”, and “Motivation”. While OP’s story does include elements of a regretful perspective of their past behaviors - which is both understandable and typical - the overarching theme of this post is that of an uplifting and motivating story.

<h1>Analysis</h1>

<h2>Post Type</h2>

As [indicated in outcome charts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1opwM-WOR9CYIlIkLm0gMSzwbKo-SXUlmR3jL_ihsIW4/edit?gid=130034604#gid=130034604), the top two most frequently-occurring Post Types are the “Confessional” (31%) followed closely by the “Day Count” (29%), suggesting that the majority of Reddit users are posting to the community as a means of seeking relief from burdensome, unwanted emotions and to publicly track their ability to maintain gambling abstinence.

<h2>Emotional Content</h2>

Not surprisingly, outcome charts display a range of emotional content, seemingly equally desirable and undesirable. **Hopelessness**, **Regret**, and **Motivation** tie at 13.6% in frequency, while expressions of **Hope** lead the range at 18.2%.

<h1>Interpretations & Implications</h2>

The usefulness of this project toward the development of the Evive Community can imply that we may expect similar motivations and expectations by our users when given the opportunity to engage in the community.

One noteworthy observation is that “Day Count” Post Types sometimes include screenshots of various abstinence-tracking apps. These users are already using discreet tracking tools yet still choose to share their progress publicly. One interpretation is that the users are seeking community validation, either by hoping for positively reinforcing comments or simply by deriving a sense of normalization through the act of public disclosure. However, it is difficult to know the degree to which the anonymity offered by Reddit factors into the users’ decisions.

A potential confounding factor is that Reddit may have a distinct, sitewide set of cultural elements that affect the decision making processes of its users. For example, users who are accustomed to the platform may be more likely to perceive a sense of kinship and comfort with other Reddit users, positively shaping their motivation to engage in the community. Users new to Evive may be inexperienced in posting personal information publicly - even if anonymously - increasing the need to provide compelling incentives to engage in the Evive community.
