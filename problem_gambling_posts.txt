Title: Has anyone found a replacement for online gambling?
Text: I’ve been doing really well for the last month and half. I would be lying if I said I haven’t relapsed a couple of times, but I’ve managed to walk away if I’m up or down. 

I’m fully aware of how risky this is and have been in this situation too many times to know how it usually ends. The problem is I work from home so I always have my phone with me so there’s always that temptation to gamble as it’s so easy. 

This might be a stupid question but has anyone found a replacement that’s obviously not as exciting as gambling but still gets your heart racing a little? I guess I just need a little excitement to help forgetting about gambling. Not sure how healthy this is but I’m wondering if it’s an option rather than just going cold turkey as this just hasn’t helped in the past.

Title: DK Slot Was Literally Rigged Due To 'Glitch'
Text: Basically, an online slot game on DK wouldn't return any money to players. One player told DK about it and the gambling company accused him of a gambling problem. DK also tried to cover it up. Wild story. Wonder how many other 'glitches' are never discovered. Wrote about this on my blog if anyone wants to read more.

Title: I did it again.. relapsed and lost 3.4K 
Text: Don’t even gamble 20-30$

I stopped by a bar on my way home and slipped 30$ into a machine.. felt good because I was able to take the 30$ loss and walk away. That was no problem. 

Later that night I got bored and signed up to another online casino.. deposited 200$ went up to 2.4K started placing 60$ bets and brought it down to 0$ and then ended up depositing another 3.2k of my money. 

Moral of the story, when you stop, stop completely. I had 0 urges after 11 days gamble free, until I played that 30$ and then spiraled into another huge loss. 

I will be working this month for free just to get that money back. So fucken stupid!

Title: It’s fucked up how quickly your brain forgets the pain of gambling.
Text: You lose all the money you have, you cry, you feel horrible, you feel disguested, you swear to never gamble again as it causes nothing but pain to you.

Next day, some money hits your account and you think "yeah a small depo won't hurt" 

It's absolutely fucked up. Just the day before, like many times in the past, you've lost everything and you've felt the absolute worst. You've felt and seen the horror of what it does to you. Yet your brain still wants to do it the next chance it gets.

Title: My first day 
Text: Hey all,

My name is Murph and I have come to accept that I have a gambling addiction. I’m fortunate to be catching it early enough.

Over the past few months it started by putting in 20 bucks every pay check into stake, then that turned into every other day,  bartering with “well I can just use my next check to cover the cost”. Boredom is consistent at my job, isolating for 30-minutes turned into 2-3 hours. It’s way more fun to gamble than sit and do boring office work. I completely rationalize my gambling habits as justified for all the hard work I do. 

It came to a head after my next 2 big wins. $900, then $800, and $1400 huge wins. I was down $1200 and I fulfilled every gamblers dream of breaking even and more.

I cashed out $2200 and I was $1000 up and even had $1000 left over for myself after. I had money leftover to play all the blackjack I’d want for fun! This can last me forever! I even told my wife I’ll buy her that no bookshelf she wanted!

I lost that $1000 within the day. The next morning, I began the chase “I’ll just deposit $100 and hit big again and be back up and cash it. Yes, that’s what I’ll do.” $100, after $100, after $100. I sank deeper into the whole. Within a span of 2 days I lost the $1000 I had stashed in Stake and $1000 in my account. 

I put a “break in play” on my account as I scared the hell out of myself “Who am I?” I spent a few more days no gambling, then I fell back into my old routine “Next best Stake alternative” and I proceeded to find another casino to pursue my thrill of blackjack and slots. 

It was up until yesterday’s chase, I spent $500 within that day and this past weekend I chased for another $300. 

I do not like who I am becoming. I am fortunate to be in therapy but I have been shameful to admit my gambling problem. Today marks the day I get help from my support group while I still have my savings, a job to help me recover the losses, and to begin my recovery. 

I hate what these casinos do to you and I hate casinos.

Text: I haven’t gambled for a little over half a year, but I’m so lonely. I think when I used to gamble my mind was so fixated on betting so I never thought about it but since I quit it’s been on my mind a lot. Since I never had money or really time due to gambling I lost more or less most of my friends. Right now I’m at my parents house pursuing a degree from a school but I just really feel trapped. Currently also not working because I don’t feel like there’s a point. Luckily no real feelings to gamble because I know it won’t fix anything but I really just feel sad. I feel like I never treated my friends poorly other than not having that much time to hang, but perhaps that’s the definition of a bad friend. Not really sure what I even wanted to say anyways

Title: Why is it hard to believe that there's cheating and not only a house edge? 
Text: Whenever I mention that the games must be rigged or that there's cheating at casinos, the common response is because the house has an edge and the player will lose the longer they play. Although that is true, I would go further to say that several casinos are actually cheating its players whether it be card swapping tech, adjustable  algorithms that can manipulate payouts, or surveillance measures. People who worked at casinos themselves have said that they could mess with the ratios. It leads me to believe that the purported auditing is circumvented or insufficient.

Aside from what I saw were suspicious outcomes of cards dealt based on the players' betting sizes, the one I went to literally had a touchpad device next to the dealer and he was scanning people's facial recognition as they sat down at the table. You are absolutely being monitored the moment you walk in. If it was that easy to go in and make a consistent income from gambling, everyone would do it which is not the case. They'll let you get some then take it all back as a part of their business model

I haven't thought about gambling since I stopped. I pissed away multiple loans and sunk further into debt, the pain was enough to give me a different perspective.

I got an email today from a casino I used to play at saying my self exclusion had expired. I immediately opened up the site to renew the self exclusion, but I hovered over the confirm button for a good 30 seconds figuring out if it was okay to have a little punt.

Luckily I clicked confirm and removed access, but man that little blip in my brain letting me know it would be okay to just have a go really hasn't gone away.

I have realized that I cannot be left alone, I need to be accompanied 24/7 by someone I know it sounds so bizarre but it is true. Whenever I'm with my partner I don't gamble because first I am scared of her finding out and leaving me and two I don't want her to see me on my phone all the time which will make her get distant from me. And also when I am with my partner I realize the repercussions of gambling even more but the moment I am alone, it is like I am a zombie. Deposit after deposit. No matter how many blocks I put in place, I always find a way to overcome these blocks.

I will also share some more resources I’ve found online in the next few weeks.

I wrote this article a few weeks ago about the difference between addiction and recovery.

**Success through abstinence**  
Abstinence involves the complete cessation of all gambling activities and is often seen as the first and most essential step in the recovery process. Achieving success in abstinence is characterized by an individual's ability to stop gambling entirely, avoiding triggers and environments associated with their addiction. This may involve practical measures such as enrolling in self-exclusion schemes, steering clear of casinos and gambling websites, and staying away from gambling-related discussions or content.

**Success through recovery**  
Recovery, however, is a broader and more comprehensive process that goes beyond simply stopping gambling. It involves addressing the root causes and impacts of addiction, encompassing psychological, emotional, and social factors. While abstinence is a critical component of recovery, true success in recovery is marked by a more extensive transformation in the individual's life.

Title: Almost 3 months clean
Text: Coming up on 3 months clean, turning 20 this month and lost around 1300 the night I decided to call it quits.

Banned online for 5 years, been around gambling with friends chatting and showing their bets but stayed true to my promise and not went back. Got a nice little amount in savings I luckily didn't blow and managed to make the money back I lost in around a month or two. 

Continuing to build my savings and hopefully have enough for a house deposit in the next 5 years or so.

No more stress constantly thinking of gambling in the back of my head. No more depressed nights and mornings. No more budgeting to make it to payday on £100.

Not thinking of my losses really at all anymore, put it behind me and focusing on the future.

Was tough the first few weeks but now that I'm closing in on 3 months the urges are gone.

If your young like me and f\*\*\*\*\* up young, try to stop now. There's plenty of time to fix your mistakes no matter how much you lost.

I was alone, money on hand and recently lost my job and leverage trading hypnotized me enough to make it feel not only like an escape but an answer to all my problems. Total loss close to 40.000 euro's probably. In that time I found out that even if you win, it's designed to make you lose. The fees, taxes, stress and inevitable losses are not worth it. My wins became less frequent as panic set in, I was never going to climbed out of the hole I dug and small bets slowly scaled up to thousands at a time.

What finally solved my problems was giving financial control to my father, getting a job I actually want to wake up and work hard for. I found a supportive girlfriend and share my feelings and slowly save 1000 euro's a month to build my future. I still give myself a weekly allowance to do things I wouldn't before, having had nothing changed my perspective entirely.

It's slow and boring, but it's safe and smart. I check here almost every day to keep myself in check. I'm not sure why I decided to post but I know people are out there reading this with that horrible feeling in their stomache feeling like they have no choice but to go down the spiral. I hope this post proves things can change. At my low I was ready to steal, sell my posessions and do anything to get that rush, it was at that low where something spoke to me and I finally woke up and told everything to my parents. Please tell someone and get better.

Title: 668 days gratefully without a bet
Text: Today:

·      I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

·      I am grateful that we made it home safely from Britain.

·      I am grateful for my parent’s selflessness.

·      I am grateful that our dog was okay and healthy while we were away.

·      I am grateful that night 1 of jet lag wasn’t too bad.

·      I am grateful for knowing that while my vacation is now over, that doesn’t mean life starts to suck again. I have a choice in how I approach life and to both accept and embrace it for what it is and not how the mind wants it to be.  

·      I am grateful to know that life will always have its ups and downs, that’s just how it is. My journey includes learning each day how to handle both.

Title: Forgive Yourself
Text: I'm a little past the year marker in terms of putting money into my self-destructive gambling habit. It's weird, in a way, because I feel I've made little progress, but it really is something. I'll never get back that money, and it'll likely take decades to get back to similar financial condition I was in before. There will definitely be a scar in my psyche for the rest of my life as well. 

But, little by little, I'm forgiving myself. Forgiveness is so important, in my opinion, to heal and reduce the likelihood I fall back into those habits in the future. 

Something else that's helped me a bit has been to gradually open up to people I'm close with about my gambling struggles. It means a lot when a friend reminds me of the progress I've made because they know some of my journey. 

It's a long, long journey. It's not easy, and there is likely not going to be a sudden coalescing into feeling okay. But that, itself, is okay. Remember that one of the biggest things lost when in the bowels of gambling addiction is time, whether that be with family, friends, or oneself. Forgiving yourself is part of the process in re-claiming your time. It's time to move forward.

Title: Day1🙏
Text: Today is the day I mark no more gambling. I have lost around 15k. Today I have realized it is not worth it.

About me: 0 in bank.
-800 euros credit card debt.
I am a university student still living at his mother’s house luckily.

I can pay off the credit card debt at the end of the month because I get paid 1.4K. After this I will have 600 to go through the month with.

I hope I can stick to this. It will take me about 1 year to save back the money I lost if my contract still gets extended at September.

Text: Hello guys, first of all I do not recommend gambling to anyone. Please do not gambling I just need this off my chest.

A few weeks ago I lost 5k to this shit and since then I have been trying to get this back. 
I have known about gambling and yesterday I total deposited around 2.3k, on my last 250 I was able to get this up to 3.3k.

I should have just stopped I hate myself so much. In the end I cashed out 2.5k but 1 hour later this was back in the casino and I lost it all. So I lost 2.5k of my own money basically and now I hate myself my heart has been thumping all night. What pisses me off is that I didn’t even need to play, I could have just gone to bed like why do I do this to myself.

I am just 19 and in total around 10k+ lost at the casino. Wow, I’m such a fool.

Title: The game is rigged
Text: How do you think MGM or all the other big casinos pay for everything they own, buildings, employees, machines, luxury, hotels..

Its all been paid by gamblers. The edge is too big. The house ALWAYS win. If you win its just a loan theyre giving to you until you comeback.

You gotta understand how every fucking game is mostly designed for you to wager as much money as posible so they can rake in their house edge.

Slots are the best example, those mfs will pay you 5-50% of your bet and make it look like if youre winning, music and flashlights will appear, meanwhile they keep raking their 3-20% per spin (depending on slot rtp %(return to player)).

At some point one must just accept that this empire was not built upon winners and that playing the game means you can end up being another corpse in their walls.

Tens of thousands got ruined by live casinos in the past. One can just imagine how its going now with online casinos.

Being able to play 24/7. Infinite amount of games to choose from. More sophisticated games that exploit even more the human brain to hook him until he has nothing left but regret.

You cannot win. You most likely cant make what you lost back. That is how this works.

Once you accept that reality you should remember it everytime u get an urge.

Do you want to give more money to that human garbage who exploits people like us with addictions?

Youre literally giving the time god gave you and you used to make money to pay for you life expenses to those devils. Literally like selling your soul.

And I know it well, been here since i was 13, they got me young. Exploited my mental illness with their tricks.

But at some point you will see how pointless it is to keep engaging with it.

THE ONLY WAY TO WIN IS TO NEVER PLAY AGAIN

Now go for a walk, read this as many times as you need and take a decision to never play again.

Be a strong human for you, your family and each one of us who suffered in that place.

Title: Relapsed again and lost $7k
Text: Simply at a loss for words now. I bet banker, it's player. I bet player, it's banker. I bet dragon, it doesn't hit until I leave. I don't bed dragon, it hits time after time after time.

I have 20, the dealer pulls 21. I have 11 and double down when the dealer shows a 4, I get 17 total and they pull 20.

It's like nothing worked/works.

I'm at a loss for words at this point. I lack self control when it comes to gambling and even when I do gamble it seems like I rarely ever win when it counts.

With that being said, I lost a total of $60,000 in the last 3 months. All of my credit cards are maxed out and I'm just at a loss for words.

Title: Options and futures gamblers, can we ever trade again?
Text: 
I'm clean 4 months after having my entire life revolve around day trading for 2 years. It started off fine, but I had a large loss that made me desperate to win it all back, which led to gambling. Less and less money led to riskier and riskier moves until I had nothing left. 

I traded with a group of professional day traders who had a very regimented way to trade - I want to clarify that these were older men in the finance industry, not some random kids on Twitter with a paid Discord server. I did great trading with them until that loss that led me to gamble. 

My question is, do you think I could ever go back to trading that regimented method again, or am I ruined for life? I really enjoyed trading and learning, but obviously I'm afraid that I will fall back into old habits. I would appreciate the opinions of anyone who has been clean for a while.

Title: Tiktok sports cards gambling
Text: Posted this in the card hobby forum but thought it would be interesting to get perspectives in here aswell.

So about 6 months ago I started buying into sports breaks on Tiktok, at first it was a bit of fun and I enjoyed it but recently I've sat back and taken stock on what I've spent and what I've actually gotten in return. I've probably spent over £5000 easily on breaks and all I have to show for it is a few half decent cards (around the £50 mark) and a huge pile of toploaded cards worth nothing clogging up my room. I got massively caught up in the buzz of the "chase" and the possibility that I might hit a big card or a 1/1 worth thousands! Of course the reality is this never happened and I never actually hit anything. It's only now I realise that I probably was addicted to the buzz of the "chase" much like a problem gambler. 

The main breaker I used on tiktok was Onyx breaks, who gets in the ballpark of the numbers backyardbreaks do in the UK, so pretty big! No hate towards him at all but in his streams he always says things like "you've got your spot back", "your paid" or "let's check comps to see how much that cards worth". If people aren't buying quickly enough, the classic move is always the same, go online and show the massive hits from the product that you could get like the 1/1 and big Autos which drives people to buy in and of course never pops out of the packs. It's only now I look back on this experience I realise that the whole thing is about the possibility to make money. I think this is a massive issue especially the amount of kids on Tiktok and how unregulated it is, but that's another issue (other tiktokers such as epicbreaks getting an honourable mention). There are some breakers where it seems like money is not the driving force and the focus is more on the hobby and the cool cards pulled however they are few and far between. Even when I did occasionally get a card worth my spot back (which was very rare), I didn't want it as it wasn't what I was interested in collecting anyway.

I have had had a gambling problem in the past and have an extremely addictive personality and didn't twig that all I was doing was gambling until I look back on it because it feels so harmless at the time and that you are investing in collectibles.

These are just my thoughts on my experience on what seems to be a massive backdoor to gambling instead of what the hobby is for and certain individuals need to take more responsibility in my opinion as to the language they are using. The certain breaker I mentioned probably clears £2000 a night on breaks which all props to them but I think this could become a massive issue in regards to unregulated gambling. 

Interesting to hear your guys thoughts on it are and whether you've had an issue with this or not.

Cheers for reading

Title: I can’t stop gambling. Borderline suicidal 
Text: I’m 100K in debt and I’m 23. I have just thrown away a fairly succesful business and owe creditors $8000. I have had a problem with gambling since I was 18 that’s has been on and off. I dropped out of university because of gambling, I didn’t get my license because of gambling and now I’m overseas getting stock for my business that my parents rely on to live and have blown every last every cent. $30 000 in total. It’s the biggest scam there is & I know the ammount of money I’ve lost is never coming back. How it is legal is baffling to me and how it is so promoted shouldn’t be allowed. My YouTube feed is just gambling even after I have asked not to be recommended this type of content, I have blocked almost all gambling streams and still my YouTube feed is filled with it. I understand how bad and evil the industry is but for the life of my I can’t stop. It’s an itch that takes over me and completely blinds me from the consuquences that will follow. I’m not sure if I’m more predisposed to it. My mom is a gambling addict as well as my uncle & my brother just blew his college tuition gambling. 

I have no idea what to do now and how I am going to get the $8000 that I owe. I have no degree, am living such a unhealthy lifestyle and have lost all my confidence. Life honestly feels like hell. I have become so desensitised and honestly feel dead inside. I feel like I would be better off killing myself

Text: Today:

I am grateful for 24 hours without a bet.

I am grateful for this vacation to the UK. It is coming to its end, this is always the way it is.

I am grateful that we got to the airport in one piece and are able to relax before our flight.

I am grateful that though I know I have a lot of work to do upon my return, I know it will be dealt with at the appropriate time. There is no use dwelling on it now. 

I am grateful to let things be as they are as best I can. The more I do this, the more peaceful I feel inside.

I am grateful that I’m learning each day how to handle situations, including when not to jump in and make things more complicated and difficult.

I am grateful that I’ve seen through this vacation that my son’s desire to become more independent is really high, and his confusion about how to be manifests itself in stubbornness and isolation. That feels awfully familiar to me! 

I am grateful that now and throughout the flight I will focus on my breath, be patient, watch my mind, relax, and try to let things go, one at a time. 

I am grateful for GA and the spiritual traditions that have changed the direction of my life towards serenity and peace. Each day, I choose to focus on not going back to my old life by placing that next bet. That’s good enough for me.

He’s committed to therapy and GA meetings and given me logins to all his accounts/ cut up his cards. 

My question for partners of gamblers is, do things ever feel “normal “ again. Or will I be checking over my shoulder forever? I’m committed to helping, and I want him to be healthy for our child. Just curious what this looked like for you 1,2,5, 10 years in.

Title: Day 28 - Long Read but Feeling Great
Text: August has been an extremely long and emotional month for me. But after months of gambling all my money away, I feel like its been one of my most progressive months.

My girlfriend found out about my gambling and basically gave me an ultimatum, its either her or the gambling. My friends found out about my gambling and haven't been very supportive at all – they heard rumours that I wasn't doing good mentally and when I told them about my gambling and how severe it was all they could do was laugh at me and roast me - this was Aug 21^(st) and none of them have checked in with me since (some friends they are). But despite it all, I feel like I have made a lot of progress…

Although there is a lot of debt to pay, I haven't gambled for a total of 28 days... wow! I know that doesn't sound like a long time, but I was literally at rock bottom at the beginning of August. Constantly breaking down, crying, feeling sorry for myself and just thinking about how dumb I was for putting myself in this position. I genuinely couldn’t see a way out. So I decided to quit both gambling and weed at the same time and move forward with my life. I don't want to speak too early but, I feel like this was the best decision I could've ever made. My mood feels so much better, I don't feel as lazy, I feel sharper mentally, the brain fog has gone and I don't feel the cravings. Ultimately, I still feel horrible for being in the position I am but, I can't let the past drag me down. I fucked up, I made mistakes but its how we bounce back from them!

Please my fellow redditors don’t give up hope!! I promise you; you can do this. Take it one day at a time and fight for your life. We are better than this people. The only way you can fight that mental disease is by building good habits and shouting louder than the demons in our head.

It has taken me a while to come to terms with my situation, I'm going to have a lot of hard months ahead. But, I've been offered a second job (weekend work) and I am going to work harder than ever to get my debts cleared off. As long as I have the love and support from my girl and my family, I can achieve anything. You can too! The financial problems we are suffering are a symptom of the gambling. If you can kill the gambling, the finances look after themselves. I know 28 days isn't much to brag about but if I, a degenerate gambler who has taken money from friends, family, loan etc. and gambled it away, can do it – then you can too. We can't be victims of this any longer.

 My phone literally broke yesterday... and I don't even feel mad about it. If it happened at the beginning of August I probably would've had a mental breakdown and scream thinking the world isn't fair lol!

Title: Thinking you have it under control 
Text: I just want to tell my story about gambling with some of you people who may of been in a similar situation as I was, I've always enjoyed gambling even as a kid me and my family would take trips down to massachusetts  see family and my uncle would give me money to run across the street and get scratchtickets for all of us. I was only about 13 at the time but I vividly remember those moments it was always so much fun especially as a kid winning 20$ was a big deal.... 

But back then it wasn't a issue I mean I was only a kid and only did that with my family in mass a couple times a year but around high school junior-senior year I got into crypto I was working at JC Penny at the time making maybe 10-12$ a hour I tried getting into trading bitcoin and other useless crypto coins I probably lost around a couple grand before I gave that up for good. 

then came the time i moved down to Massachusetts in 2017 after I graduated high school for a job that my sisters bf got me it was a decent job i was making about 25$ a hour to start which was decent for being 18 years old and living with your uncle paying 500$ a month in rent. At this time I wasn't gambling with crypto or anything else I was just working and saving some money.... then a few months into me working somehow I figured out you could gamble at 18 years old at twin rivers casino in rhode island and this is around the time i really started to have a problem gambling Literally from the ages of 18-22 I would essentially spend every dime I made at this casino every weekend of course some nights I won but of course as you all know it all ends up going back into the casinos hands...... Now for whatever reason in my head I never had a problem with this because #1 all of my bills are paid still, and #2 I absolutely refused to ever gamble on credit/loans so whatever money i lost i could technically "afford" to lose.....

  
Now I eventually stopped going to the casino around 2 years ago in about 2022 as I was disgusted with how much money i've spent gambling and tried quitting for good. At this time i was making around 40$ a hour still living with my uncle and had just about no debt. And everything was good for a couple months I didn't go to the casinos at all and was finally saving money again not blowing every dollar i made to the casino....

  
I'd say at about the start of 2023 my friend introduced me to this website called stake and within just a few mere weeks i'd blown through all of my savings I had and started gambling every week again on payday.... right back in that vicious cycle and around this time I was making about 50$ a hour so I was at about 100K a year more if you include the overtime we work, So this goes on for a couple months now were in middle of 2023 Still gambling every single week, and one random day I blew all my gambling money already for the week so I started to look up sweepstake casinos that would take CC payments (Hands down the dumbest mistake of my life) Finally found 1 and decided to do a measly 200$ deposit as I told myself i would never gamble on credit and this was a 1 time thing, well as you all know how compulsive gamblers work within just a week or so I'd maxed out all 3 of my cards totalling around 15K$ dollars I was devastated Told myself that this was a line i'd never cross and I have to stop. So what I did was take out a personal loan to pay off all my cc debt which would save me $ as the interest rate was much lower.

Now From that point middle of 2023 to I'd say 2024 I didn't gamble much I occasionally on payday would spend maybe 200$ and then either profit a little bit or just stop after 1 deposit. 

  
Now this Is where everything gets really bad start of 2024 I start gambling heavy again blowing most of my paychecks to stake and being miserable but hey my loans and rents/bills are paid so it is what it is. But one random week Just Like last time I ran out of money for the week and told myself I was just going to make 1 small deposit on my credit card and make some money and stop.... well just like last time I lost within 5 minutes and kept depositing and Maxxed out my credit cards again So now i'm around 27K in debt about 13K from my loan and 15K from my credit cards AGAIN. I was absolutely crushed by this feeling knowing i just set my life so far back and made the same mistake AGAIN.... So I quit gambling again telling myself this is it and I can't keep on living like this anymore.....



flash forward to a month ago im doing okay trying to pay off my bills and not gamble which I was doing good at I figured I could maybe have one of my family friends lend me 13K to pay off my credit cards and save money with the interest being so much lower... Long story short I got the money and paid off my credit card debt again but still being about 25K in debt. Now I truly don't know what the actual fuck is wrong with my brain but I had a 2nd chance at doing the right thing and I fucked it all up AGAIN right before I started to type this I just maxxed out all of my cards again for the 3rd time.... just feeling so fucking hopeless I don't  even know what to do anymore.... I just hope If any young people see this post they don't make the same mistakes I did you don't want to go down this deep dark road like I have to.



  
TLDR: just maxxed out my credit cards for the 3rd time about 40k in debt from gambling don't know what to do anymore. think my brains broken beyond repair

Title: Day 1
Text: Countless attempts of suicide, countless attempts of quitting, I tried so many ways to avoid myself to do it again, I’m currently working in overseas, saved up quite a bit, its the last week of my contract and i almost messed up all my savings throughout my work here, i was like 15,000$ down, over half of my hard-work is gone, I am getting really sick and tired of this relapse and cycle. But at least I am not in debt YET, it is finally time to end this, I have been gambling for the better part of my life and it never ends well, even though I was a big winner from time to time, but it means nothing when the money does not comes from proper work, I cried myself to sleep yesterday, I felt so sorry for my single mom and sisters, but it is never too late, I will check in here every single day, I wish people can actually stop and move on with their lives, prior coming to work in overseas, I stole, sold drugs, done all sorts of sorry ass stuff just to pay back the debts, I will NEVER go back to the “good old days”, and I wish everyone around me here the best. I have been through hell because of gambling, I have lost over 100,000$ in my whole life prior to this, I fucked up my high school, dropped out of college due to unable to pay for the funds, and its just shit storm after shit storm, my dad even passed away knowing that I was in debt, I am not exactly better now, but I am trying my best to be the best version of myself.

Title: I was doing so good..... 
Text: Man oh man..

I was doing so good, I thought I kicked the can for real. I made a few bets because I was doing a small challenge using left over money I won from a bet ( I withdrew my deposit and some) two weeks of a nice ladder challenge. I end up losing it and started rage betting. VIRTUAL BLACKJACK.. F******* disgusting, and I kept rage betting and depositing and went down about 1200-1400 in probably 1-2 hours easily. I now find myself trying to deposit more and chase and chase and I am spiraling now. I can't believe the chokehold this stupid stupid stupid thing has on me, it's become nothing to lose money. Just in july I did the same thing and swore I wouldn't ever again but here I am. I feel like a dumbass, it's not even about the money but more this drained feeling of just worthlessness and like I am setting myself back over and over with this addiction thinking i'm going to get lucky once and quit. I can't believe how dumb I am to even play Video Blackjack. I have finally excluded myself from all this nonsense, 

I am sorry to the ones who I reached out to and commented on your posts with advice / words of encouragement as I have let you all down. I genuinely feel empty. I know the $$ amount isn't a lot but it adds up over this year and this addiction is unlike anything else i've faced. I am 24/yo and it's crazy how so young I feel so defeated over something so dumb. I tell others what I should be doing for myself, it really is easy to say but hard to do. I need to find joy in life again, this year has been awful, bottom of the barrel awful. I can't believe I am so dumb. This with trying to find a new job, it's just been tough. I hope we all reach a new light one way or another and realize the disease this really is. The money sucks but the mental aspect of it all is far worse. 

It's so accessible. Open my phone, transfer and within 1-3 minutes I can be gambling it all. F*** ... I am extremely disappointed I did it again. I hope one day to look back and see this as one big lesson for a bigger picture. I will be more active here or try to be as I was at my best when trying to help others. 

The worse part about it is if anyone ever asks I just say i'm fine, "you haven't ate today". I'm fine. "you seem upset" I'm fine. It's f***** embarrassing that this has a chokehold on me like it does. I never would've thought. 

Hope you all have a blessed day, and thank you to the ones always spreading hope and positivity here when you can. I'm sure you all have saved lives of people you wouldn't even recognize if they were standing right beside you.

Keep spreading hope for the ones who haven't crossed the bridge to freedom yet, life is more than this.

Title: Day 263: I will never miss wasting entire weekends gambling 
Text: I have had many weekends chasing losses where come Monday it felt like I never had time off at all. 

It may have started innocent enough with that first Saturday early game looking for that quick adreline rush. Then that lost. Then the doubling and tripling up, then the in-game wagers to recoup part of the losses.

Then rinse and repeat Sunday. 

So while others feel rejuvenated, refreshed and motivated to start the week, my self abuse would leave me tired, stressed and moody, with a long week ahead. 

Money aside, consider the long term cost of this to your physical and mental health, your work and personal relationships, and your motivation. 

If this continued long term how could I be focused and productive at work? I would be the employee there in body not in spirit, who does the minimum to avoid getting fired. 

Instead of the person I want to be who connects with colleagues, earns raises and bonuses, and advances in his career. 

Plus I had time today to work out, get good food from a Mexican restaurant, clean my house and my car. When our environment is less cluttered our mind seems to follow. 

Hope you have a great weekend! 

ODAAT! 💪

Text: Is there a plan you followed? I am trying to think of a way to reward myself for not gambling. I’m at a moment in time where this hasn’t started to really impact my finances, but I can feel the addiction and it really stresses me out. Earlier today I deposited $100, ran it up to $200, cancelled the withdrawal, got to 300, then lost it all. I hate the feeling of not having control and then the thoughts of the money I would’ve had. 

I’m not running myself into debt or losing money that will impact my life, but I am scared because I can see myself getting there eventually.

Title: Don't care about upcoming NCAAF and NFL Season and it's just a wonderful feeling!
Text: After years of up and down sports gambling I put myself on the 5-year self-exclusion list. It has honestly been the best decision I've made in a long time. It's opened my eyes to what really went on for years. Now, I just sit down to watch sports as a fan. No longer have to worry about spreads or over/unders. 

I've noticed a serious mental and physical switch has been turned. I've started exercising more (already have lost 15 pounds from not sitting in front of a PC or TV every night). My wife and I have booked our dream Caribbean vacation in November...That would have been unheard of years ago. I have no desire to ever do it again and that was just the push that was needed. 

If you're on the fence - do it! You won't regret it.

Get outside and get some vitamin D, spend time with loved ones, put the phone down and away. Reach out to others going through similar issues as you are. Support is everything especially this time of the year for us.

Title: His friends
Text: My partner has been a gambler for most of his life, since he was a teen. He is trying to stop and has self excluded, banned himself from online casinos, blocked his bank cards from allowing gambling transactions and entrusted me with most of our finances.

But now when he wants to gamble he borrows a tablet from a friend, logs into his friend's casino account and borrows money to pay for the gambling. Multiple friends have enabled him this way. Then he comes to me and asks me to pay back these people who have helped him gamble. I said no to one and that friendship, one which was longer than my partnership with my partner, has crumbled. My partner blames me, I think.

I've had a text message exchange with another friend politely asking him to stop but he said basically he is my partner's friend, not mine, so will do what my partner wants. 

I'm at a loss for what to do. If I don't pay them back, friends are lost. If I do, these friends keep helping my partner with his addiction, which is no help at all. My partner is a lovely person apart from his addiction and I think that's why his friends want to "help" him. He's known these people since he was young. Some also have their own addictions and occasionally when my partner has money he has given them some (to my irritation). 

I don't want to be the gatekeeper to his friendships but I don't think these friendships are good either. But who am I to judge others.

Title: I fucked up
Text: First post here. I was 30 days clean, since my birthday. The longest I’ve been clean since this issue started a year ago. Ive lost probably around 10k in the last year and Im a student with a part time job. Im 5k in debt, i have absolutely zero money and I had just got paid around a grand from work. Ive been feeling stressed and depressed so i thought a little controlled gambling would take the edge off and once i started i couldn’t stop. I was in this haze and a few hours later $1000 disappeared. Its not a lot in the grand scheme but it was all my money, i owe my credit card 1k, i owe my parents 4500$ and we arent well off. Its a huge sum of money for them and me. I’m only 23 and i know the world isn’t ending but it’s hard not to feel that way. Does it get better? Can it get better? Any help or resources are appreciated.
